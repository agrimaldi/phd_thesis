abstract = {The role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of lipocortin 1 (LC1) mRNA/protein expression in the brain is uncertain. This study has examined the influence of dexamethasone on the disposition of LC1 protein in various central and peripheral tissues in the rat. LC1 was readily detectable in all tissues studied by Western blot analysis. Exposure to dexamethasone in vitro (0.1 microM, 3 h) or in vivo (20 micrograms/100 g i.p., 24 h before autopsy) had no discernible effects on intracellular LC1 levels but increased the amount of LC1 attached to the outer surface of cells (pericellular LC1) in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland and peritoneal macrophages (in vitro only). The results suggest that in central tissues, as in the periphery, glucocorticoids promote the translocation of LC1 from intracellular to pericellular sites.},

abstract = {The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) requires coregulators to bind effectively to response elements in target genes. A strategy of sequential screening of expression libraries with a retinoic acid response element and RAR identified a cDNA encoding a coregulator highly related to RXR alpha. This protein, termed RXR beta, forms heterodimers with RAR, preferentially increasing its DNA binding and transcriptional activity on promoters containing retinoic acid, but not thyroid hormone or vitamin D, response elements. Remarkably, RXR beta also heterodimerizes with the thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors, increasing both DNA binding and transcriptional function on their respective response elements. RXR alpha also forms heterodimers with these receptors. These observations suggest that retinoid X receptors meet the criteria for biochemically characterized cellular coregulators and serve to selectively target the high affinity binding of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors to their cognate DNA response elements.},

No consistent changes in plasma concentrations of T4 or GH were observed. In post-hatching chicks, corticosterone and dexamethasone depressed the circulating concentrations of both T4 and T3. Iopanoc acid, an inhibitor of liver T4-5' monodeiodinase, elevated plasma concentrations of T4 and depressed those of T3 in both chicken embryos and young chicks. It is suggested that glucocorticoids affect circulating concentrations of T4 and T3 both by affecting the activity of the liver T4-5' monodeiodinase and by influencing the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.},

abstract = {The human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) beta, a splicing variant of the classic receptor hGRalpha, functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of hGRalpha. We explored the mechanism(s) underlying this effect of hGRbeta by evaluating the interactions of this isoform with known steroid receptor coactivators. We found that hGRbeta suppressed the transcriptional activity of both activation function (AF)-1 and AF-2 of hGRalpha, indicating that hGRbeta may exert its dominant-negative effect by affecting the function of coactivators that are attracted to these transactivation domains. hGRbeta bound to one of the p160 coactivators, the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) via its preserved AF-1 but not via its defective AF-2 in vitro. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, hGRbeta prevented coprecipitation of GRIP1 with hGRalpha tethered to glucocorticoid response elements of the endogenous tyrosine aminotransferase promoter, whereas deletion of the AF-1 of hGRbeta abolished this effect. In further experiments, overexpression of GRIP1 attenuated the suppressive effect of hGRbeta on hGRalpha-mediated transactivation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Competition for binding to glucocorticoid response elements or heterodimerization with hGRalpha via the D loop dimerization interface occurred, but they were not necessary for the suppressive effect of hGRbeta on the transcriptional activity of hGRalpha. Our findings suggest that hGRbeta suppresses the transcriptional activity of hGRalpha by competing with hGRalpha for binding to GRIP1, and possibly other p160 coactivators, through its preserved AF-1. These findings suggest that participation of hGRbeta in the formation of a coactivator complex renders this complex ineffective.},

abstract = {Members of the mammalian p160 family, such as GRIP1, are known as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) coactivators; at certain glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), however, GRIP1 acts as a GR corepressor. We characterized functional interactions of GR and GRIP1 in a repression complex where GR tethers to DNA-bound activator protein-1 (AP-1), as at the human collagenase-3 gene, and tested whether the identified interactions were similar or different at other response elements. At the AP-1 tethering GRE, we mapped the GRIP1 corepressor activity to a domain distinct from the two known GRIP1 activation domains; it exhibited intrinsic GR-independent repression potential when recruited to DNA via Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, neither the domain nor the activity was detected in the other two p160 family members, SRC1 and RAC3. The same GRIP1 corepression domain was required for GR-mediated repression at the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) tethering GRE of the human IL-8 gene. In contrast, at the osteocalcin gene GRE, where GR represses transcription by binding to a DNA site overlapping the TATA box, both GRIP1 and SRC1 corepressed, and the GRIP1-specific repression domain was dispensable. Thus, in a single cell type, GR and GRIP1 conferred one mode of activation and two modes of repression by selectively engaging distinct surfaces of GRIP1 in a response element-specific manner.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) have several regulatory functions in vertebrates. In the absence of thyroid hormone (T3; tri-iodothyronine), apo-TRs associate with co-repressors to repress transcription, whereas in the presence of T3, holo-TRs engage transcriptional coactivators. Although many studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms of T3 action, it is not known how specific physiological responses arise. We used T3-dependent amphibian metamorphosis to analyse how TRs interact with particular co-regulators to differentially regulate gene expression during development. Using chromatin immuno-precipitation to study tissue from pre-metamorphic tadpoles, we found that TRs are physically associated with T3-responsive promoters, whether or not T3 is present. Addition of T3 results in histone H4 acetylation specifically on T3-response genes. Most importantly, we show that individual T3-response genes have distinct co-regulator requirements, the T3-dependent co-repressor-to-coactivator switch being gene-specific for both co-regulator categories.},

Phenotype analysis has shown that the two genes serve distinct functions: TRalpha is crucial for postnatal development and cardiac function, whereas TRbeta mainly controls inner ear and retina development, liver metabolism and thyroid hormone levels.

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is a pleiotropic regulator of growth, differentiation and tissue homeostasis in higher organisms that acts through the control of target gene expression. Most, if not all, major T3 actions are mediated by specific high affinity nuclear receptors (TR) which are encoded by two genes, THRA and THRB. Several TRalpha and TRbeta receptor isoforms are expressed. Abundant and contradictory literature exists on the relationship between circulating thyroid hormone levels, thyroid diseases and human cancer. In 1986, a connection between TR and cancer became evident when the chicken TRalpha1 was characterized as the c-erbA proto-oncogene, the cellular counterpart of the retroviral v-erbA oncogene. V-erbA causes erythroleukemias and sarcomas in birds, and hepatocellular carcinomas in transgenic mice. In recent years, many studies have analyzed the presence of quantitative (abnormal levels) or qualitative (mutations) alterations in the expression of THR genes in different types of human neoplasias. While their role in tumor generation or progression is currently unclear, both gross chromosomal and minor mutations (deletions, aberrant splicing, point mutations) and changes in the level of expression of THRA and THRB genes have been found. Together with other in vitro data indicating connections between TR and p53, Rb, cyclin D and other cell cycle regulators and oncogenes, these results suggest that THRA and THRB may be involved in human cancer.},

abstract = {The strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids are mediated primarily by the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors. These receptors are members of the steroid hormone receptor family, a superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and exert genomic effects that can result in increased expression of regulatory-including anti-inflammatory-proteins (transactivation), or decreased production of proinflammatory proteins (transrepression). Transactivation is thought to be responsible for numerous adverse effects of glucocorticoids; transrepression is thought to be responsible for many of the clinically desirable anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids. Optimized glucocorticoids, such as selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists, are being developed to try to minimize the adverse effects many patients experience. Glucocorticoids also exert their effects via rapid, nongenomic mechanisms that can be classified as involving nonspecific interactions of glucocorticoids with cellular membranes, nongenomic effects that are mediated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors, or specific interactions with membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors. Increased understanding of these mechanisms of glucocorticoid action could enable the development of novel drugs with which to treat patients with inflammatory and autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {Thyroglobulin (19 S, 660,000) (Tgb), the specific glycoprotein of the thyroid is the support of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. It is a dimer formed of 2 identical subunits (12 S, 330,000) containing a peptide chain of Mr 300,000 to which are associated through the asparagine of Asn-X-Thr (Ser) sequences, 2 types of carbohydrate units. The peptide chain is encoded in a 33 S mRNA of 8500 bases. The nature and number of Tgb genes, their transcription and the nuclear processing of premessenger RNA are unknown. However, the recent obtaining of clones of DNA complementary to Tgb mRNA will allow a rapid study of these structures and events. Tgb chains are synthesized on heavy polysomes associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Nascent chains are then glycosylated by association of an oligosaccharide chain (GIcNAc)2 (Man)n (Glc)n' preassembled on a lipid carrier in the membrane, followed by removal of outer glucose and elongation in the Golgi membranes to produce branches of the type NeuNAc leads to Gal leads to GlcNAc. Possible roles for oligosaccharides in the structure and biosynthesis of Tgb are actively investigated. Then the fully glycosylated protein undergoes iodination that leads with a high yield to thyroid hormone formation according to a complex process critically depending upon the native 3-dimensional structure of the protein. Thyrotropin is likely to regulate Tgb production at the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels. Cell model systems for the study of Tgb biosynthesis and thyroid function are discussed.},

abstract = {Although glucocorticoid (GC)-induced nongenomic effects have been reported, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplained. We previously described that lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES (FYN) mediate GC-induced inhibition of T-cell-receptor (TCR) signalling. Here we characterize the underlying molecular mechanism. The present study shows that the GC receptor is part of a TCR-linked multiprotein complex containing heat-shock protein (HSP)90, LCK and FYN, which is essential for TCR-dependent LCK/FYN activation. Experiments with cells transfected with GC-receptor short interfering RNA (siRNA) showed that the GC receptor is an essential component of the TCR signalling complex. Short-term GC treatment induces dissociation of this protein complex, resulting in impaired TCR signalling as a consequence of abrogated LCK/FYN activation. HSP90siRNA-transfected cells are not able to assemble this TCR-associated multiprotein complex, and accordingly HSP90siRNA treatment mimics GC effects on LCK/FYN activities.

abstract = {The effects of thyroid hormone on brain development and function are largely mediated by the binding of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) to its nuclear receptors (TR) to regulate positively or negatively gene expression. We have analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction the effect of T3 on primary cultured cells from the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex, on the expression of Hr, Klf9, Shh, Dio3, Aldh1a1, and Aldh1a3. In particular we focused on T3 receptor specificity, and on the crosstalk between T3, retinoic acid and dexamethasone. To check for receptor subtype specificity we used cerebrocortical cells derived from wild type mice and from mice deficient in thyroid hormone receptor subtypes. Receptor subtype specificity was found for Dio3 and Aldh1a1, which were induced by T3 only in cells expressing the T3 receptor alpha 1 subtype. Interactions of T3 with retinoic acid signaling through the control of retinoic acid metabolism are likely to be important during development. T3 had opposing influences on retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes, increasing the expression of Aldh1a1, and decreasing Aldh1a3, while increasing the retinoic acid degrading enzyme Cyp26b1. Dexamethasone increased Klf9 and Aldh1a1 expression. The effects of T3 and dexamethasone on Aldh1a1 were highly synergistic, with mRNA increments of up to 20 fold. The results provide new data on thyroid hormone regulation of gene expression and underscore the importance of thyroid hormone interactions with retinoic acid and glucocorticoids during neural development.},

abstract = {Intestinal metamorphosis in anurans is an excellent model system for studying post-embryonic tissue remodeling and organ development in vertebrates. This process involves degeneration of the larval or tadpole form of its primary functional tissue, the simple tubular epithelium through apoptosis or programmed cell death. Concurrently, adult epithelial stem cells, whose origin remains to be determined, proliferate and differentiate to form a multiply folded, complex adult epithelium. The connective tissue and muscles also develop extensively during this period. Like all other changes during amphibian metamorphosis, intestinal remodeling is controlled by thyroid hormone (TH). Isolation and characterization of genes that are regulated by TH has implicated the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during intestinal metamorphosis. Here we will review some studies, almost exclusively in Xenopus laevis, that support a role of MMPs, particularly stromelysin 3, and ECM remodeling in regulating cell fate and tissue morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The temporal relationship between the occupancy of the thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)) and glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) receptors and the rate of growth hormone (GH) gene transcription and mRNA accumulation were investigated. The GC line of cultured rat pituitary tumor cells was used in these studies. The rate of GH gene transcription was measured by elongation of in vivo initiated RNA chains in isolated nuclei using radioactive precursors and hybridization of labeled transcripts to immobilized GH gene sequences. T3 receptor occupancy was directly proportional to the rate of GH gene transcription during the initial phase of hormone induction. These results suggest that a single occupied receptor is sufficient to fully activate the gene and that the unoccupied receptor resides close to the gene regulatory site. A decrease in GH gene transcription rapidly followed the initial increase in activity. This decrease occurred in the absence of new protein synthesis and was not accompanied by a proportional decrease in the level of occupied T3 receptor. An analysis of dexamethasone activation of GH gene transcription found maximum stable binding of occupied receptor to nuclei within 5 min of hormone addition, while transcription of the gene did not become fully activated until 30 to 60 min later. Transcription of the gene then declined to a rate 2 to 3 times that observed before addition of dexamethasone. These results suggest that at least one relatively slow molecular step precedes glucocorticoid hormone-receptor enhancement of gene transcription and that a second molecular event later attenuates the response. The simultaneous addition of both hormones produced two peaks of enhanced transcription, each apparently due to the separate effects of the hormones. GH mRNA levels were closely linked to the rate of transcription of the gene under all induction conditions. Comparison of the rates of decay of GH mRNA in cells cultured in the presence or the absence of hormones suggests that GH mRNA is much more stable when T3 is present. The glucocorticoid responses of the gene were consistently obtained only in the presence of T3. These results and the transcriptional synergism of the two hormones suggest a direct interaction of the occupied receptors at their regulatory sites. The transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids were observed only in about half the experiments performed in the absence of T3. When transcriptional activation did not occur, GH mRNA usually still increased 24 h after hormone treatment was begun, but not early in the induction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Here we report that increased pup licking and grooming (LG) and arched-back nursing (ABN) by rat mothers altered the offspring epigenome at a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene promoter in the hippocampus. Offspring of mothers that showed high levels of LG and ABN were found to have differences in DNA methylation, as compared to offspring of 'low-LG-ABN' mothers. These differences emerged over the first week of life, were reversed with cross-fostering, persisted into adulthood and were associated with altered histone acetylation and transcription factor (NGFI-A) binding to the GR promoter. Central infusion of a histone deacetylase inhibitor removed the group differences in histone acetylation, DNA methylation, NGFI-A binding, GR expression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to stress, suggesting a causal relation among epigenomic state, GR expression and the maternal effect on stress responses in the offspring. Thus we show that an epigenomic state of a gene can be established through behavioral programming, and it is potentially reversible.},

After treating young tadpoles with a cortisol receptor agonist (dexamethasone) for 1 wk, students can easily visualize the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on the intact thymus gland, which shrinks dramatically in size in response to this steroid hormone analog. However, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone is nullified in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486, which powerfully illustrates the specific effects of glucocorticoid receptor inhibition on the immune system.

@article{Adams2003,
abstract = {We have tested the commonly held hypothesis that glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) must dimerize via their DNA binding domain (DBD) to bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) and induce gene expression. Guided by the GR dimerization-deficient dim/dim knock-in mouse, which expresses normal mRNA levels of the strictly GR-dependent phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene, we analyzed in detail the regulation of the PNMT 5'-flanking region using wild-type GR (GRwt) and GR dimer mutants (GRdms). We demonstrated that mouse and rat PNMT 5'-regulatory fragments are more strongly induced by GRdms than by GRwt. Footprinting analysis revealed five regions where a GR-DBD peptide could bind. We delineated a 105-bp region containing two footprints with near-consensus glucocorticoid response elements and multiple half-sites that was sufficient for transactivation via both GRwt and GRdms. Finally, we demonstrated direct binding of GRdms proteins to this responsive region using EMSA. We propose that on a subset of GR-responsive promoters, exemplified by the PNMT gene, GRs can form concerted multimers in a manner that is independent of the DBD-dimer interface. We further suggest that protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that support such complexes are essential for activation of this type of gene, and that DNA binding of GR might be essential to survival.},

abstract = {Energy balance and lipid metabolism were investigated in transgenic mice bearing an antisense glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) gene construct that impairs the normal expression of the GCR gene. Food intake was recorded during the 15 days preceding decapitation of adult normal and transgenic mice, and feces were collected to derive the digestible energy intake. Body composition measurements consisted of the determination of energy, protein, and fat content of the carcass. Carcass energy was determined by bomb calorimetry, whereas carcass protein was measured by the Kjeldahl procedure. Energy expenditure was estimated from the continuous oxygen consumption (VO2) monitoring over a 24-h period. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was quantified in epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), heart, and vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) by measuring the in vitro hydrolysis of labeled triolein in the presence of tissue homogenates. Norepinephrine (NE) content of both interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and heart were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Energy intake and expenditure were significantly lower in transgenic mice than in controls. Concurrently, both fat content and total energy of the carcasses were significantly higher in the transgenic animals. In comparison with normal mice, heart and VLM LPL activity was significantly reduced in transgenic mutants. There was no difference between groups in LPL activity in WAT. Finally, heart and BAT NE contents were lower in transgenic animals than in control mice. These results suggest that a defective GCR system may affect energy balance through increasing energetic efficiency, and they emphasize the modulatory effects of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis changes on muscle LPL activity.},

abstract = {How the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activates some genes while potently repressing others remains an open question. There are three current models for suppression: transrepression via GR tethering to AP-1/NF-$\kappa$B sites, direct GR association with inhibitory elements (nGREs), and GR recruitment of the corepressor GRIP1. To gain insights into GR suppression, we used genomic analyses and genome-wide profiling of GR, p65, and c-Jun in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We show that GR mediates both activation and repression at tethered sites, GREs, and GRIP1-bound elements, indicating that motif classification is insufficient to predict regulatory polarity of GR binding. Interestingly, sites of GR repression utilize GRIP1's corepressor function and display reduced histone acetylation. Together, these findings suggest that while GR occupancy confers hormone responsiveness, the receptor itself may not participate in the regulatory effects. Furthermore, transcriptional outcome is not established by sequence but is influenced by epigenetic regulators, context, and other unrecognized regulatory determinants.},

abstract = {PRL and T3 are involved in antagonistic regulations during various developmental processes in vertebrate species. We have studied cross-talk between transcription factors activated by these signaling pathways, i.e. signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) and thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1). Liganded TRbeta1 in the presence of its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor gamma (RXRgamma), inhibited the PRL-induced Stat5a- and Stat5b-dependent reporter gene expression by up to 60\%. This T3-inhibitory effect studied on Stat5 activity was partly reversed by overexpression of a TRbeta1 dominant negative variant mutated within its nuclear localization signal (TR2A). We next showed that TRbeta1 and TR2A in the presence of RXRgamma increased and decreased, respectively, Stat5 localization into the nucleus regardless of hormonal stimulation. Thus, our data suggest that TRbeta1 can be associated with Stat5 in the cytoplasm and may be involved in Stat5 nuclear translocation. In PRL-treated cells overexpressing TRbeta1/RXRgamma, both Stat5 and TRbeta1 were coimmunoprecipitated, indicating physical association of the two transcription factors. In these cells, addition of T3 with ovine (o)PRL decreased the amounts of total and tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5 in the cytoplasm compared with oPRL-treated cells. In the nucleus, no clear difference was observed on Stat5 DNA-binding after treatment with PRL and T3 vs. PRL alone in TRbeta1/RXRgamma transfected cells. However, antibodies directed against TRbeta1 lowered Stat5-DNA binding and addition of the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) relieved T3 inhibition on Stat5 transcriptional activity. Thus, we postulated that the negative cross-talk between TR and Stat5 on target genes could involve histone deacetylase recruitment by liganded TRbeta1.},

abstract = {Prolactin and glucocorticoid hormone are signals which regulate the transcription of milk protein genes in mammary epithelial cells. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which these hormones cooperate in the induction of transcription. Both hormones activate latent transcription factors in the cytoplasm of mammary epithelial cells. Prolactin exerts its effect through binding to the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor and through receptor dimerization. This leads to the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase (Jak2), which is noncovalently associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the prolactin receptor. Jak2 phosphorylates the signal transducer and transcription activator (Stat5) which causes its dimerization and nuclear translocation where Stat5 specifically binds to sequence elements in the promoter regions of milk protein genes. In comparison, the glucocorticoid receptor is activated by a lipophilic steroid ligand in the cytoplasm which causes allosteric changes in the molecule, dimerization, and nuclear localization. It has been demonstrated that Stat5 and the glucocorticoid receptor form a molecular complex which cooperates in the induction of transcription of the beta-casein gene. We have defined the DNA sequence requirements for this cooperative mechanism and have delimited the functional domains in Stat5 and the glucocorticoid receptor that are necessary for the functional interaction. We find that the Stat5 response element (Stat5RE) within the beta-casein gene promoter is sufficient to elicit the cooperative action of Stat5 and the glucocorticoid receptor on transcription. Activation of Stat5 through phosphorylation of tyrosine 694 is an absolute prerequisite for transcription. Deletion of the transactivation domain of Stat5 results in a molecule which cannot mediate transactivation by itself but can still cooperate with the glucocorticoid receptor. Mutated variants of the glucocorticoid receptor with a nonfunctional DNA binding domain or a DNA binding domain contributed by the estrogen receptor are still able to cooperate with Stat5 in transcriptional induction. Deletion of the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor does not impede cooperation with Stat5, whereas deletion of the AF-1 transactivation domain does prevent cooperation. Our results indicate that the glucocorticoid receptor acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator of Stat5 independently of its DNA binding function.},

abstract = {A recent focus meeting on Controlling Acute Inflammation was held in London, April 27-28, 2006, organized by D.W. Gilroy and S.D. Brain for the British Pharmacology Society. We concluded at the meeting that a consensus report was needed that addresses the rapid progress in this emerging field and details how the specific study of resolution of acute inflammation provides leads for novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics, as well as defines the terms and key components of interest in the resolution process within tissues as appreciated today. The inflammatory response protects the body against infection and injury but can itself become dysregulated with deleterious consequences to the host. It is now evident that endogenous biochemical pathways activated during defense reactions can counter-regulate inflammation and promote resolution. Hence, resolution is an active rather than a passive process, as once believed, which now promises novel approaches for the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases based on endogenous agonists of resolution.},

abstract = {Previously we reported that the negative regulation of the TSHbeta gene by T(3) and its receptor [thyroid hormone receptor (TR)] is observed in CV1 cells when GATA2 and Pit1 are introduced. Using this system, we further studied the mechanism of TSHbeta inhibition. The negative regulatory element (NRE), which had been reported to mediate T(3)-bound TR (T(3)-TR)-dependent inhibition, is dispensable, because deletion or mutation of NRE did not impair suppression. The reporter construct, TSHbeta-D4-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which possesses only the binding sites for Pit1 and GATA2, was activated by GATA2 alone, and this transactivation was specifically inhibited by T(3)-TR. The Zn finger region of GATA2 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of TR in a T(3)-independent manner. The suppression by T(3)-TR was impaired by overexpression of a dominant-negative type TR-associated protein (TRAP) 220, an N- and C-terminal deletion construct, indicating the participation of TRAP220. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with a thyrotroph cell line, TalphaT1, revealed that T(3) treatment recruited histone deacetylase 3, reduced the acetylation of histone H4, and caused the dissociation of TRAP220 within 15-30 min. The reduction of histone H4 acetylation was transient, whereas the dissociation of TRAP220 persisted for a longer period. In the negative regulation of the TSHbeta gene by T(3)-TR we report that 1) GATA2 is the major transcriptional activator of the TSHbeta gene, 2) the putative NRE previously reported is not required, 3) TR-DNA-binding domain directly interacts with the Zn finger region of GATA2, and 4) histone deacetylation and TRAP220 dissociation are important.},

abstract = {Rat c-erbA beta 1 mRNA rises in cerebrum during the first 10 days of life, coincident with an increase in tissue triiodothyronine (T3) levels and T3-dependent brain development. These data suggest that the beta 1 receptor may mediate the T3 effect. However, in cerebellum c-erbA beta 1 mRNA levels were very low. Since cerebellar development, including dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells, is a T3-sensitive process, we assessed the levels of the beta 1 receptor protein in cerebellum during development. Antisera to unique peptide regions of beta 1 were raised. Their specificity was demonstrated by specific immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated product, 85\% immunoprecipitation of the T3 binding activity in hepatic nuclear extracts, and Western blot analysis of tissue extracts. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-beta 1 antiserum stained liver nuclei but not testis nuclei, which contain no T3 binding activity or beta 1 mRNA. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, an immunofluorescent signal, localized to the nucleus and more intense than that seen in the liver, was observed. A positive but weaker signal was also present in the granule cells. Thus, we may infer that the cerebellum contains significant concentrations of beta 1 receptor protein despite the low beta 1 mRNA content. Both the intensity of staining in Purkinje cell nuclei and immunoprecipitable beta 1 receptor binding capacity rose in the neonatal period. Antiserum to the non-T3 binding alpha 2 variant protein was also prepared and a distinctive pattern of fluorescence was observed. Strong fluorescence was seen in the nuclei of granule cells, but none was seen in Purkinje cells. The alpha 2 fluorescence in testis was high, consistent with the high levels of alpha 2 mRNA in this tissue. The fluorescent signal appeared to originate primarily in dividing spermatogonia. Our findings support the concept that the beta 1 receptor plays a central role in T3-induced brain development and strongly suggest that the Purkinje cell is a direct target for T3.},

abstract = {Thyroxine (T(4)) is the predominant form of thyroid hormone (TH). Hyperthyroidism, a condition associated with excess TH, is characterized by increases in metabolic rate, core body temperature and cardiac performance. In target tissues, T(4) is enzymatically deiodinated to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), a high-affinity ligand for the nuclear TH receptors TR alpha and TR beta, whose activation controls normal vertebrate development and physiology. T(3)-modulated transcription of target genes via activation of TR alpha and TR beta is a slow process, the effects of which manifest over hours and days. Although rapidly occurring effects of TH have been documented, the molecules that mediate these non-genomic effects remain obscure. Here we report the discovery of 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM), a naturally occurring derivative of TH that in vitro is a potent agonist of the G protein-coupled trace amine receptor TAR1. Administering T(1)AM in vivo induces profound hypothermia and bradycardia within minutes. T(1)AM treatment also rapidly reduces cardiac output in an ex vivo working heart preparation. These results suggest the existence of a new signaling pathway, stimulation of which leads to rapid physiological and behavioral consequences that are opposite those associated with excess TH.},

@article{Fu2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are members of the superfamily of Zn2+ dependent extracellular or membrane-bound endopeptidases which have been implicated to play critical roles in vertebrate development and human pathogenesis. A number of MMP genes have been found to be upregulated in some or all organs during frog metamorphosis, suggesting that different MMPs may have different functions in various organs/tissues. The recent advances in EST (expressed sequence tag) sequencing and the completion of the genome of Xenopus (X.) tropicalis prompted us to systematically analyze the existence of MMPs in the Xenopus genome.

RESULTS: We examined X. laevis and X. tropicalis ESTs and genomic sequences for MMPs and obtained likely homologs for 20 out of the 25 MMPs known in higher vertebrates. Four of the five missing MMPs, i.e. MMPs 8, 10, 12 and 27, were all encoded on human Chromosome 11 and the other missing MMP, MMP22 (a chicken MMP), was also absent in human genome. In addition, we identified several novel MMPs which appears to be derived from unique duplications over evolution, are present in the genomes of both Xenopus species.

CONCLUSION: We identified the homologs of most of the mammalian MMPs in Xenopus and discovered a number of novel MMPs. Our results suggest that MMP genes undergo dynamic changes over evolution. It will be of interest in the future to investigate whether MMP expression and functions during vertebrate development are conserved. The sequence information reported here should facilitate such an endeavor in the near future.},

abstract = {The effects of temperature and steroids [testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and corticosterone (B)] on premetamorphic growth and development were investigated in the toad (Bufo boreas). The effects of steroids were both temperature and age dependent. In the first experiment, steroids (1.1-1.4 microM) were administered by dissolving them in the water beginning 1 day after hatching at 22 degrees C or 27 degrees C. At 22 degrees C, B inhibited growth (P < 0.001) but had no significant effect on development. Forelegs never emerged in B-treated animals and all died before complete tail resorption. Discontinuation of B treatment allowed normal growth and metamorphosis, but the resulting post-metamorphic animals were significantly shorter (snout-vent length, P < 0.001) than after other treatments. At 22 degrees C, T and E2 had no effect on larval growth and development or size at metamorphosis (P > 0.05), but T induced early foreleg emergence (FLE) (P < 0.005). At 27 degrees C, B was fatal after 2 weeks of treatment, and T and E2 inhibited growth (P < 0.001) and development (P < 0.001), but did not affect time to FLE. In a second experiment at 27 degrees C, treatment with 1.1 microM B starting 15 days after hatching induced early metamorphic events (P < 0.001), such as tail resorption and emergence of the left foreleg (but not the right), but jaw and head restructuring failed to occur. All B-treated animals died before complete tail resorption. In a third experiment, 0.275 and 1.11 microM B, starting at day 43 (stage 43), induced early FLE (P < 0.05) and decreased snout-vent length at tail resorption (P < 0.005) without a dose effect. A higher dose of B (4.44 microM) decreased snout-vent length at tail resorption and time to FLE (P < 0.05) but did not affect body weight at metamorphosis (P > 0.05). Animals in this experiment survived to complete tail resorption and transformed normally. The actions of B in these experiments closely resemble those observed with administration of thyroid hormones, suggesting that steroids may interact with endogenous thyroid hormones.},

abstract = {Metamorphosis, classically defined as a spectacular post-embryonic transition, is well exemplified by the transformation of a tadpole into a frog. It implies the appearance of new body parts (such as the limbs), the resorption of larval features (such as the tail) and the remodelling of many organs (such as the skin or the intestine). In vertebrates, metamorphosis has been well characterized in anuran amphibians, where thyroid hormones orchestrate the intricate and seemingly contradictory changes observed at the cellular and tissue levels. Thyroid hormones control a complex hierarchical cascade of target genes via binding to specific receptors, TR$\alpha$ and TR$\beta$, ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Metamorphosis is actually widespread in the vertebrates, though quite diverse in the way it manifests in a particular species. Furthermore, evolutionary and ecological variations of this key event, from paedomorphosis to direct development, provide an excellent illustration of how tinkering with a control pathway can lead to divergent life histories. The study of invertebrate chordates has also shed light on the origin of metamorphosis. The available data suggest that post-embryonic remodelling governed by thyroid hormones is an ancestral feature of chordates. According to this view, metamorphosis of the anurans is an extreme example of a widespread life history transition.},

abstract = {The changes in gene expression leading to tail resorption that are initiated by thyroid hormone (TH) were studied in Xenopus laevis. Four of the less than 10 genes that are down-regulated during this period have been isolated; their mRNAs decay with identical kinetics. Twenty of the approximately 35 genes that are up-regulated in the first 48 h have been isolated. The up-regulated genes fall into two kinetic patterns. After a lag of several hours, the direct response genes (including thyroid hormone receptor beta) increase their mRNA level steadily for 24-48 h. The delayed genes respond mainly in the second 24 h after TH addition. The importance of these genes for tail resorption is supported by the fact that they are all regulated developmentally during normal metamorphosis in tail and respond to hormone induction when the tail becomes competent to respond to TH. The relatively simple gene expression program leading to tail resorption is contrasted with the complex and multiple periods of gene expression during limb development. The gene expression screen defines the tail resorption program and has isolated the majority of TH-regulated genes.},

Furthermore, we present evidence that the flip out of the methylated cytosine induced by UHRF1 binding is unlikely essential for subsequent DNA methylation by DNMT1. Together, our study demonstrates that UHRF1 can target DNMT1 for DNA maintenance methylation through binding either H3K9me2/3 or hemi-methylated CpG, and that the presence of both binding activities ensures high fidelity DNA maintenance methylation. In addition, our study indicates that UHRF1 mediates cross-talk between H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation at the level of DNA methylation maintenance.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones are of crucial importance for the functioning of nearly every organ. Remarkably, disturbances of thyroid hormone synthesis and function are among the most common endocrine disorders affecting approximately one third of the working German population. Over the last ten years our understanding of biosynthesis and functioning of these hormones has increased tremendously. This includes the identification of proteins involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis like Thox2 and Dehal where mutations in these genes are responsible for certain degrees of hypothyroidism. One of the most important findings was the identification of a specific transporter for triiodothyronine (T3), the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) responsible for directed transport of T3 into target cells and for export of thyroid hormones out of thyroid epithelial cells. Genetic disturbances of MCT8 in patients result in a biochemical constellation of high T3 levels in combination with low or normal TSH and thyroxine levels leading to a new syndrome of severe X-linked mental retardation. Importantly mice lacking MCT8 presented only with a mild phenotype, indicating that compensatory mechanisms exist in mice. Moreover, it has become clear that not only genomic actions of T3 exist. T3 is also capable to activate adhesion receptors and it signals via activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways. Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones. So far it is believed that thyronamines function via the activation of a G-protein coupled receptor, TAAR1. The objective of this review is to summarise the recent findings in thyroid hormone synthesis and action and to discuss their implications for diagnosis of thyroid disease and for treatment of patients.},

abstract = {We have investigated the influence of the N-terminal domain of the 94-kDa glucocorticoid receptor on the DNA:receptor interaction. An alpha-chymotrypsin-induced 39-kDa receptor fragment, containing the hormone and DNA binding domains, binds DNA with a reduced specificity compared to the intact 94-kDa receptor. Various footprinting assays did not reveal any qualitative differences when comparing the DNA contact points made by the two different receptor entities. Like the intact receptor, the 39-kDa receptor fragment binds as a dimer to DNA. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking demonstrated a difference in the protein:protein contacts of the two homodimers. Furthermore, the dimeric 94-kDa receptor did not recognize a half-DNA site, while the dissociated 94-kDa receptor dimer and the dimeric 39-kDa receptor fragment allowed binding to such a site. These results suggest that the loss of the N-terminal domain of the receptor affects the steric arrangement and/or rigidity of the two DNA binding domains of the receptor homodimer, resulting in a decreased DNA binding specificity of the 39-kDa receptor fragment.},

abstract = {Integrin alpha(V)beta(3) is a heterodimeric plasma membrane protein whose several extracellular matrix protein ligands contain an RGD recognition sequence. This study identifies integrin alpha(V)beta(3) as a cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone [L-T(4) (T(4))] and as the initiation site for T(4)-induced activation of intracellular signaling cascades. Integrin alpha(V)beta(3) dissociably binds radiolabeled T(4) with high affinity, and this binding is displaced by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, alpha(V)beta(3) antibodies, and an integrin RGD recognition site peptide. CV-1 cells lack nuclear thyroid hormone receptor, but express plasma membrane alpha(V)beta(3); treatment of these cells with physiological concentrations of T(4) activates the MAPK pathway, an effect inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, RGD peptide, and alpha(V)beta(3) antibodies. Inhibitors of T(4) binding to the integrin also block the MAPK-mediated proangiogenic action of T(4). T(4)-induced phosphorylation of MAPK is inhibited by small interfering RNA knockdown of alpha(V) and beta(3). These findings suggest that T(4) binds to alpha(V)beta(3) near the RGD recognition site and show that hormone-binding to alpha(V)beta(3) has physiological consequences.},

It was important to retain the mesenchymal tissue joining the two limb buds in order to obtain limb development in culture. T3 added to tail explants from the same larvae, cultured in parallel with limb buds, induced regression and cell loss at rates comparable to those seen during T3-induced metamorphosis in intact tadpoles. We also demonstrate for the first time that 0.2 units of prolactin (PRL) added at the same time as 2 x 10(-9) M T3 totally blocked both limb development and tail regression over 8 days in culture. When added after T3 had initiated its metamorphic action. PRL arrested further morphogenesis and regression of these two tissues, respectively. Retinoic acid at 10(-7) M had only a marginal effect. Histological examination showed that T3 added to limb buds produced normal chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro as well as skin, muscle, and digit formation, while it produced a rapid and marked histolysis of fin and connective tissue of the tail. The ease of hormonally manipulating both morphogenesis and cell death in culture in opposite directions offers a simple, effective model system for molecular analysis of mechanisms underlying hormone-regulated postembryonic developmental processes.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) are highly effective in combating inflammation in the context of a variety of diseases. However, clinical utility can be compromised by the development of side effects, many of which are attributed to the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to induce the transcription of, or transactivate, certain genes. By contrast, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are due largely to their ability to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. This effect has been predominantly attributed to the repression of key inflammatory transcription factors, including AP-1 and NF-kappaB, and is termed transrepression. The ability to functionally separate these transcriptional functions of GR has prompted a search for dissociated GR ligands that can differentially induce transrepression but not transactivation. In this review, we present evidence that post-transcriptional mechanisms of action are highly important to the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, we present the case that mechanistically distinct forms of glucocorticoid-inducible gene expression are critical to the development of anti-inflammatory effects by repressing inflammatory signaling pathways and inflammatory gene expression at multiple levels. Considerable care is therefore required to avoid loss of anti-inflammatory effectiveness in the development of novel transactivation-defective ligands of GR.},

abstract = {The type 1 deiodinase (D1) is thought to be an important source of T3 in the euthyroid state. To explore the role of the D1 in thyroid hormone economy, a D1-deficient mouse (D1KO) was made by targeted disruption of the Dio1 gene. The general health and reproductive capacity of the D1KO mouse were seemingly unimpaired. In serum, levels of T4 and rT3 were elevated, whereas those of TSH and T3 were unchanged, as were several indices of peripheral thyroid status. It thus appears that the D1 is not essential for the maintenance of a normal serum T3 level in euthyroid mice. However, D1 deficiency resulted in marked changes in the metabolism and excretion of iodothyronines. Fecal excretion of endogenous iodothyronines was greatly increased. Furthermore, when compared with both wild-type and D2-deficient mice, fecal excretion of [125I]iodothyronines was greatly increased in D1KO mice during the 48 h after injection of [125I]T4 or [125I]T3, whereas urinary excretion of [125I]iodide was markedly diminished. From these data it was estimated that a majority of the iodide generated by the D1 was derived from substrates other than T4. Treatment with T3 resulted in a significantly higher serum T3 level and a greater degree of hyperthyroidism in D1KO mice than in wild-type mice. We conclude that, although the D1 is of questionable importance to the wellbeing of the euthyroid mouse, it may play a major role in limiting the detrimental effects of conditions that alter normal thyroid function, including hyperthyroidism and iodine deficiency.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Several studies have indicated the important role of dendritic cells (DCs), highly specialized antigen-presenting and immunomodulatory cells, in GC-mediated suppression of adaptive immune responses. Recently, we demonstrated that triiodothyronine (T3) has potent immunostimulatory effects on bone marrow-derived mouse DCs through a mechanism involving T3 binding to cytosolic thyroid hormone receptor (TR) $\beta$1, rapid and sustained Akt activation and IL-12 production. Here we explored the impact of GCs on T3-mediated DC maturation and function and the intracellular events underlying these effects. Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic GC, potently inhibited T3-induced stimulation of DCs by preventing the augmented expression of maturation markers and the enhanced IL-12 secretion through mechanisms involving the GC receptor. These effects were accompanied by increased IL-10 levels following exposure of T3-conditioned DCs to Dex. Accordingly, Dex inhibited the immunostimulatory capacity of T3-matured DCs on naive T-cell proliferation and IFN-$\gamma$ production while increased IL-10 synthesis by allogeneic T cell cultures. A mechanistic analysis revealed the ability of Dex to dampen T3 responses through modulation of Akt phosphorylation and cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B). In addition, Dex decreased TR$\beta$1 expression in both immature and T3-maturated DCs through mechanisms involving the GC receptor. Thus GCs, which are increased during the resolution of inflammatory responses, counteract the immunostimulatory effects of T3 on DCs and their ability to polarize adaptive immune responses toward a T helper (Th)-1-type through mechanisms involving, at least in part, NF-$\kappa$B- and TR$\beta$1-dependent pathways. Our data provide an alternative mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of GCs with critical implications in immunopathology at the cross-roads of the immune-endocrine circuits.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids mediate their therapeutic actions mostly by genomic effects via cytosolic receptors, but some effects are too rapid to be mediated by changes at the genomic level. The detailed mechanisms of these nongenomic actions are still unclear. Membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors (mGCR) have been suggested to be involved, although their physiological existence in humans so far is hypothetical. For the first time we demonstrate the existence of mGCR on monocytes and B cells obtained from healthy blood donors using high-sensitivity immunofluorescent staining. Immunostimulation with lipopolysaccharide increases the percentage of mGCR-positive monocytes, which can be prevented by inhibiting the secretory pathway. Overexpression of the human glucocorticoid receptor alpha alone is not sufficient to enhance mGCR expression. These in vitro findings are consistent with our clinical observation that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the frequency of mGCR positive monocytes is increased and positively correlated with disease activity. We conclude that mGCR are 1) indeed physiologically present in healthy blood donors, but remained unidentified by conventional techniques due to their small number per cell and 2) actively up-regulated and transported through the cell after immunostimulation. These receptors may reflect a feedback mechanism of the organism upon immunostimulation and/or play a role in pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) affects diverse biological processes and can exert its effects through both gene regulation via binding the nuclear TH receptors (TRs) and non-genomic actions via binding to cell surface and cytoplasmic proteins. The critical importance of TH in vertebrate development has long been established, ranging from the formation of human cretins to the blockage of frog metamorphosis due the TH deficiency. How TH affects vertebrate development has been difficult to study in mammals due to the complications associated with the uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos. Anuran metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to address such an issue. Using Xenopus as a model, we and others have shown that the expression of TRs and their heterodimerization partners RXRs (9-cis retinoic acid receptors) correlates temporally with metamorphosis in different organs in two highly related species, Xenopuslaevis and Xenopus tropicalis. In vivo molecular studies have shown that TR and RXR are bound to the TH response elements (TREs) located in TH-inducible genes in developing tadpoles of both species. More importantly, transgenic studies in X. laevis have demonstrated that TR function is both necessary and sufficient for mediating the metamorphic effects of TH. Thus, the non-genomic effects of TH have little or no roles during metamorphosis and likely during vertebrate development in general.},

abstract = {Deiodination is a critical process by which the minimally active thyroxine (T(4)) molecule is converted into the favorite ligand for thyroid hormone (TH) receptors, triiodothyronine (T(3)). The iodothyronine deiodinases type 1, 2, and 3 (D1, D2, and D3) constitute a potent mechanism of TH activation (D1 and D2) or inactivation (D3), which functions by tissue specifically regulating TH bioavailability. D2 and D3 are widely expressed and in a dynamically and tightly coordinated fashion, thereby allowing cells to customize their own TH activity. D3, the major T(3) and T(4) inactivating deiodinase, catalyzes their conversion to 3,3'-diiodothyronine and to reverse T(3) respectively. According to common wisdom, D3 plays a major role in lowering serum TH concentrations during development, as supported by the much wider D3 tissue expression in the embryo structures than in the adult tissues. However, several recent studies show that D3 is reexpressed in adult life in various pathophysiological contexts, which strengthens the concept that cell-specific TH inactivation is a critical mediator in cellular TH metabolism. This review focuses on the progress made in understanding the physiological function and significance of D3. It summarizes the intriguing evidence that D3 plays a pivotal role in defining local TH concentration in the developing fetus and in several conditions in adult life.},

abstract = {Synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) have been used to promote lung development in preterm infants, thereby decreasing respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, yet, concern has arisen from reports that such treatment predisposes individuals to disease in adulthood. Given the variety of preclinical studies that show metabolic and behavioral abnormalities in adulthood following fetal exposure to synthetic GC, we examined the effect of in utero exposure to the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX), on hypothalamic expression of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) a central neuropeptide involved in mediating behavior and metabolic balance. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 0.4mg/kg DEX on gestational days 18-21. As adults (postnatal day (PD) 60), the offspring were fitted with temperature sensing transmitters allowing real-time monitoring of core body temperature (CBT) across the 24h light dark period. This revealed a significant decrease in CBT throughout the day in prenatal DEX-treated females on estrus and diestrus, but not in male offspring. The reduction in CBT by prenatal DEX exposure was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of Trh transcript in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of female rats at PD 60 and this effect was also present on PD7. There was also a female-specific reduction in the number of preproTRH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the PVN, with ppTRH-ir nerve fibers decreases that were present in both male and female offspring. No changes in thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3; thyroxine, T4) were observed in adult offspring, but during development, both males and females (PD14) had lower T3 and T4 levels. These data indicate abnormal expression of TRH results from fetal DEX exposure during late gestation, possibly explaining the decreased CBT observed in the female offspring.},

abstract = {11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs) catalyze the interconversion of active glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) and inert 11-keto forms (cortisone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone). 11beta-HSD type 2 has a well recognized function as a potent dehydrogenase that rapidly inactivates glucocorticoids, thus allowing aldosterone selective access to otherwise nonselective mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal nephron. In contrast, the function of 11beta-HSD type 1 has, until recently, been little understood. 11beta-HSD1 is an ostensibly reversible oxidoreductase in vitro, which is expressed in liver, adipose tissue, brain, lung, and other glucocorticoid target tissues. However, increasing data suggest that 11beta-HSD1 acts as a predominant 11beta-reductase in many intact cells, whole organs, and in vivo. This reaction direction locally regenerates active glucocorticoids within expressing cells, exploiting the substantial circulating levels of inert 11-keto steroids. While the biochemical determinants of the reaction direction are not fully understood, insights to its biological importance have been afforded by use of inhibitors in vivo, including in humans, and the generation of knockout mice. Such studies suggest 11beta-HSD1 effectively amplifies glucocorticoid action at least in the liver, adipose tissue, and the brain. Inhibition of 11beta-HSD1 represents a potential target for therapy of disorders that might be ameliorated by local reduction of glucocorticoid action, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and age-related cognitive dysfunction.},

This process results from endochondral ossification in the growth plates of long bones and is regulated by systemic hormones and paracrine or autocrine factors. The major regulators of developmental and childhood growth are GH, IGF-I, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormone. Sex steroids are responsible for the pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal fusion. This review will consider interactions between GH, IGF-I, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormone during linear growth. It is well known from physiologic and clinical studies that these hormones interact at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary. Interacting effects on peripheral tissues such as liver are also well understood, but we concentrate here on the epiphyseal growth plate as an important and newly appreciated target organ for convergent hormone action.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone is known to participate in the control of intestine maturation at weaning. Its action is mediated by the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, encoded by the TRalpha and TRbeta genes. Since previous studies have shown that TRbeta plays a minor role in the gut, we focused here our analysis on the TRalpha gene. The TRalpha locus generates the TRalpha1 receptor together with the splicing variant TRalpha2 and the truncated products TRDeltaalpha1 and TRDeltaalpha2, which all lack an intact ligand binding domain. The TRDeltaalpha isoforms are transcribed from an internal promoter located in intron 7, and their distribution is restricted to a few tissues including those of the intestine. In order to define the functions of the different isoforms encoded by the TRalpha locus in the intestinal mucosa, we produced mice either lacking all known TRalpha products or harboring a mutation which inactivates the intronic promoter. We performed a detailed analysis of the intestinal phenotypes in these mice and compared it to that of the previously described TRalpha(-/-) mice, in which TRalpha isoforms are abolished but the TRDeltaalpha isoforms remain. This comparative analysis leads us to the following conclusions: (i) the TRalpha1 receptor mediates the T3-dependent functions in the intestine at weaning time and (ii) the TRDeltaalpha products negatively control the responsiveness of the epithelial cells to T3. Moreover, we show that TRDeltaalpha proteins can interfere with the transcription of the intestine-specific homeobox genes cdx1 and cdx2 and that their activity is regulated by TRalpha1. Altogether these data demonstrate that cooperation of TRalpha and TRDeltaalpha products is essential to ensure the normal postnatal development of the intestine and that mutations in the TRalpha locus can generate different phenotypes caused by the disruption of the equilibrium between these products.},

When tadpoles at hind limb-bud stage are treated with DCA alone, their metamorphosis is completely inhibited. DCA seems to inhibit development of functional activity of the thyroid gland in the tadpoles at this stage. But when thyroxine and DCA are given simultaneously, the steroid accelerates the water loss as well as the following degenerative changes of thyroxine-induced metamorphosis: decrease in the length of trunk and tail, resorption of tail fin and opercular perforation. On the other hand, it antag- onizes slightly but significantly the effect of thyroxine on anabolic changes such as the growth of forelegs and hind limbs. It is suggested that the ratio of circu- lating amounts of thyroxine and mineralocorticoids is important in regulating the metamorphosis of anuran tadpoles.},

abstract = {This White Paper highlights the developmental period as a plastic phase, which allows the organism to adapt to changes in the environment to maintain or improve reproductive capability in part through sustained health. Plasticity is more prominent prenatally and during early postnatal life, i.e., during the time of cell differentiation and specific tissue formation. These developmental periods are highly sensitive to environmental factors, such as nutrients, environmental chemicals, drugs, infections and other stressors. Nutrient and toxicant effects share many of the same characteristics and reflect two sides of the same coin. In both cases, alterations in physiological functions can be induced and may lead to the development of non-communicable conditions. Many of the major diseases - and dysfunctions - that have increased substantially in prevalence over the last 40 years seem to be related in part to developmental factors associated with either nutritional imbalance or exposures to environmental chemicals. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept provides significant insight into new strategies for research and disease prevention and is sufficiently robust and repeatable across species, including humans, to require a policy and public health response. This White Paper therefore concludes that, as early development (in utero and during the first years of postnatal life) is particularly sensitive to developmental disruption by nutritional factors or environmental chemical exposures, with potentially adverse consequences for health later in life, both research and disease prevention strategies should focus more on these vulnerable life stages.},

abstract = {Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects in humans, termed iodine deficiency disorders, due to inadequate thyroid hormone production. Globally, it is estimated that 2 billion individuals have an insufficient iodine intake, and South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are particularly affected. However, about 50\% of Europe remains mildly iodine deficient, and iodine intakes in other industrialized countries, including the United States and Australia, have fallen in recent years. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy and infancy may impair growth and neurodevelopment of the offspring and increase infant mortality. Deficiency during childhood reduces somatic growth and cognitive and motor function. Assessment methods include urinary iodine concentration, goiter, newborn TSH, and blood thyroglobulin. But assessment of iodine status in pregnancy is difficult, and it remains unclear whether iodine intakes are sufficient in this group, leading to calls for iodine supplementation during pregnancy in several industrialized countries. In most countries, the best strategy to control iodine deficiency in populations is carefully monitored universal salt iodization, one of the most cost-effective ways to contribute to economic and social development. Achieving optimal iodine intakes from iodized salt (in the range of 150-250 microg/d for adults) may minimize the amount of thyroid dysfunction in populations. Ensuring adequate iodine status during parenteral nutrition has become important, particularly in preterm infants, as the use of povidone-iodine disinfectants has declined. Introduction of iodized salt to regions of chronic iodine deficiency may transiently increase the incidence of thyroid disorders, but overall, the relatively small risks of iodine excess are far outweighed by the substantial risks of iodine deficiency.},

In addition to the kidney, mineralocorticoid or Type I receptors are found in the brain and vascular smooth muscle where they mediate effects associated with several forms of experimental hypertension. Studies in which discrete anatomic or functional areas of the brain have been ablated demonstrate that the periventricular areas of the hypothalamus and the central sympathetic and baroreceptor systems are crucial for the development of hypertension in the renoprival, DOCA salt, and Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of aldosterone in both rats and dogs at doses that do not raise serum levels above normal produce hypertension. The hypertension produced by systemic mineralocorticoid excess, adrenal regeneration, and i.c.v. or oral administration of glycyrrhetinic acid or carbenoxolone in genetically normotensive rats and by dietary salt in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat is inhibited by the i.c.v. infusion of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or a Na+ channel-selective amiloride analog. Recent data demonstrate the extraadrenal synthesis of steroids in aortic endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and the brain. The role of the extraadrenal synthesis of steroids raises new avenues for research into the causes of hypertension.},

The egg genome is strikingly undermethylated and the sperm genome relatively methylated. Following a loss of genomic methylation during preimplantation development, embryonic and extraembryonic lineages are progressively and independently methylated to different final extents. Methylation continues postgastrulation and hence could be a mechanism initiating, or confirming, differential programming in the definitive germ layers. It is proposed that much of the methylation observed in somatic tissues acts to stabilize and reinforce prior events that regulate the activity of specific genes, chromosome domains or the X chromosome (in females). Fetal germ cell DNA is markedly undermethylated and we favour the idea that the germ lineage is set aside before the occurrence of extensive methylation of DNA in fetal precursor cells.},

abstract = {Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for treatment of many inflammatory diseases. However, long-term glucocorticoid treatment can cause a variety of negative side effects. A genome-wide microarray analysis was performed in human lung A549 cells to identify genes regulated by both the antiinflammatory steroid dexamethasone (Dex) and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF$\alpha$. Unexpectedly, we discovered that numerous genes were coregulated by treatment with both Dex and TNF$\alpha$. We evaluated the mechanism of coregulation of one of these genes, serpinA3 ($\alpha$-1 antichymotrypsin), a secreted, acute phase protein strongly associated with numerous inflammatory diseases. Up-regulation of serpinA3 requires the presence of both the glucocorticoid receptor and TNF$\alpha$ soluble receptor 1. Treatment with Dex or TNF$\alpha$ resulted in a 10- to 25-fold increase of serpinA3 mRNA, whereas coadministration of Dex and TNF$\alpha$ led to a synergistic increase in serpinA3 mRNA. The naturally occurring glucocorticoid, cortisol, also resulted in a synergistic increase in serpinA3 mRNA levels in A549 cells. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of C57BL/6 mice with Dex and TNF$\alpha$ resulted in coregulation of serpinA3 mRNA levels in both lung and liver tissues. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that glucocorticoid receptor binding to the serpinA3 transcriptional start site can be enhanced by the combination of Dex plus TNF$\alpha$ treatment of A549 cells. These studies demonstrate that glucocorticoids and proinflammatory compounds can coregulate genes associated with human disease. This discovery may underlie the basis of some of the adverse effects associated with long-term glucocorticoid therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the intestinal mucosa, numerous cytokines produced by the epithelium, fibroblasts, and immune cells were shown to affect epithelial differentiation and proliferation through epithelial-mesenchymal and epithelial-immune cell interactions. To date, the importance of cytokines in postnatal development of the rat small intestine has not been established.

AIM: To investigate the developmental changes in expression of mucosal cytokines in the postnatal maturation of the rat small intestinal epithelium and their regulation by glucocorticoids (GC).

METHODS: Mucosal maturation was assessed by the onset of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) mRNA, analysed by in situ hybridisation. The amount of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), beta2 (TGF-beta2), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and TGF-alpha was analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in mucosal extracts from weaning (14-21 days old) and adult rats, or one day after an injection of hydrocortisone (HC) in 11 day old rats. Similarly, expression of cytokines and the regulatory effect of GC were studied on cultured subepithelial myofibroblasts cloned from postnatal jejunum and ileum cultured in the absence or presence of dexamethasone (DX).

RESULTS: TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and IL-1beta decreased during the third week of life while levels of TNF-alpha increased and TGF-alpha remained constant. In parallel, SI transcripts increased and showed a progressive accumulation in the apical part of the enterocytes first localised at the base of the villi from 18 days onwards. Interestingly, precocious induction of SI mRNA by HC paralleled the decrease in expression of TGF-beta isoforms and of IL-1beta. All cytokines were expressed in the myofibroblast cell lines. In addition, the results showed that TNF-alpha was differentially expressed in basal culture conditions and after DX stimulation in jejunal and ileal myofibroblasts. DX decreased IL-1beta but not the TGF-beta isoforms, similar to that in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that mucosal cytokines are developmentally regulated and that GC are potentially involved in this regulation in parallel with maturation of the gut mucosa at weaning.},

abstract = {At metamorphic climax, anurans develop skin glands that migrate from the epidermis into the dermis. Thyroxine (T4) stimulates skin gland differentiation and migration, and a previous study showed that corticosterone (Cort) treatment of larvae is inhibitory. The current study used histological analyses to address the mechanism of Cort's prevention of skin gland development. Two types of glands were observed in controls at metamorphic climax: The first type resembled granular glands found in adults and the second resembled mucous glands. Differential staining revealed that the two gland morphologies represented functionally distinct granular and mucous glands. Treatment of larvae from Gosner Stages 35-42 with Cort or the goitrogen, thiourea (Thio), caused a reduction in the number of mucous (P < 0.05) but not granular glands. The similarity in the effects of Cort and Thio suggested that Cort inhibited skin gland development indirectly by down-regulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis. T4 treatment of larvae reversed the effects of Thio (T4+ Thio-treated animals); however, animals treated with T4+ Cort had no skin glands of either type. Triiodothyronine (T3) treatment of larvae resulted in the complete absence of skin glands with a limited number of gland nests (epidermal precursors of dermal skin glands), but stimulated epidermal growth. T3+ Thio- or T3+ Cort-treated animals also completely lacked skin glands. These data suggest that T3 favors epidermal growth at the cost of skin gland differentiation. Furthermore, we suggest that Cort inhibits skin gland development indirectly through its enhancement of T4 to T3 conversions, and that inhibition of skin glands is caused by an increase in T3 resulting from Cort treatment.},

abstract = {Triiodothyronine (T3) regulates key metabolic processes in the liver through the thyroid hormone receptor, TR$\beta$1. However, the number of known target genes directly regulated by TR$\beta$1 is limited, and the mechanisms by which positive and especially negative transcriptional regulation occur are not well understood. To characterize the TR$\beta$1 cistrome in vivo, we expressed a biotinylated TR$\beta$1 in hypo- and hyperthyroid mouse livers, used ChIP-seq to identify genomic TR$\beta$1 targets, and correlated these data with gene expression changes. As with other nuclear receptors, the majority of TR$\beta$1 binding sites were not in proximal promoters but in the gene body of known genes. Remarkably, T3 can dictate changes in TR$\beta$1 binding, with strong correlation to T3-induced gene expression changes, suggesting that differential TR$\beta$1 binding regulates transcriptional outcome. Additionally, DR-4 and DR-0 motifs were significantly enriched at binding sites where T3 induced an increase or decrease in TR$\beta$1 binding, respectively, leading to either positive or negative regulation by T3. Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by TR$\beta$1 in vivo.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of a single injection of 3,5-di-iodo-L-thyronine (3,5-T2) (150 microg/100 g body weight) on the rat liver mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus. We applied 'top-down' elasticity analysis, which allows identification of the site of action of an effector within a metabolic pathway. This kinetic approach considers oxidative phosphorylation as two blocks of reactions: those generating the mitochondrial inner-membrane potential (DeltaPsi; 'substrate oxidation') and those 'consuming' it ('proton leak' and 'phosphorylating system'). The results show that 1 h after the injection of 3,5-T2, state 4 (respiratory state in which there is no ATP synthesis and the exogenous ADP added has been exhausted) and state 3 (respiratory state in which ATP synthesis is at maximal rate) of mitochondrial respiration were significantly increased (by approx. 30\%). 'Top-down' elasticity analysis revealed that these increases were due to the stimulation of reactions involved in substrate oxidation; neither 'proton leak' nor the 'phosphorylating system' was influenced by 3,5-T2. Using the same approach we divided the respiratory chain into two blocks of reactions: cytochrome c reducers and cytochrome c oxidizers. We found that both cytochrome c reducers and cytochrome c oxidizers are targets for 3,5-T2. The rapidity with which 3,5-T2 acts in stimulating the mitochondrial respiration rate suggests to us that di-iodo-L-thyronine may play an important role in the physiological conditions in which rapid energy utilization is required, such as cold exposure or overfeeding.},

abstract = {Experiments were carried out to identify the altered genes in hyperthyroid rat heart and their influence on the functions of cardiac myocytes. Chronic treatment of rats with 3,5,3' triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) resulted in a prominent increase in the size of the left ventricle with increased wall thickness and reduced chamber volume leading to concentric cardiac hypertrophy. The heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) in hyperthyroid rats was increased by about 58\% over that of normal rats. Using cDNA microarray comprising 588 genes, we compared the differences in mRNA expression of hyperthyroid and normal rat heart. Based on a threshold of greater than 10\% change, about 37 genes were found to be regulated by T3. Further analyses by Western blotting, Northern blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR of some of the genes confirmed the microarray results. The T3-altered genes encode various types of proteins related to metabolism, matrix and cytoskeletal structures, growth factors, transcription factors, Ca(2+)-channels etc. The physiological significance of one of these altered proteins in hyperthyroid heart, insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT) type 4 (GLUT4), was studied in detail. The expression of GLUT4 was drastically reduced in the ventricular tissues of hyperthyroid heart. Insulin-induced glucose uptake in hyperthyroid cardiomyocytes was reduced significantly, indicating the impaired glucose transport in cardiac cells. Interestingly, a few genes such as GLUT4, cytochrome P450 isoforms, superoxide dismutase (SOD), collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases etc. which had not been reported earlier were found to be altered in hyperthyroid heart. Our results show some new aspects of hyperthyroid heart which will be important in assessing the pathophysiology of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes.},

Morphological and cellular studies have shown that the removal of larval organs/tissues such the tail and the tadpole intestinal epithelium is through programmed cell death or apoptosis. Recent molecular investigations suggest that TH regulates metamorphosis by regulating target gene expression through thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), which are DNA-binding transcription factors. Cloning and characterization of TH response genes show that diverse groups of early response genes are induced by TH. The products of these TH response genes are believed to directly or indirectly affect the expression and/or functions of cell death genes, which are conserved at both sequence and function levels in different animal species. A major challenge for future research lies at determining the signaling pathways leading to the activation of apoptotic processes and whether different death genes are involved in the regulation of apoptosis in different tissues/organs to effect tissue-specific transformations.},

Binding assays showed that TR homodimer formation on DNA had a low specificity and cooperativity, and very fast off rates. In contrast, TRs and retinoic acid receptors readily formed heterodimers with higher specificity and affinity on direct repeats of the AGGTCA motif spaced by four or five nucleotides, although these heterodimer/DNA complexes were only moderately stable when compared to DNA-bound TR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers. Also, TR/retinoic acid receptor heteromeric binding to other elements, including the synthetic T3RE-pal element, was of low specificity. These biochemical results suggest that TRs are unlikely to regulate transcription as homodimers in vivo, and that TR heterodimers mediate the effects of thyroid hormone.},

Steroid-binding activity is inhibited by various proteases, mercurials, and 1 M KCl, but not by DNase or RNase.

The recruitment of MeCP2 to methylated CpG dinucleotides represents a major mechanism by which DNA methylation can repress transcription. MeCP2 silences gene expression partly by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, resulting in chromatin remodeling. Here, we show that MeCP2 associates with histone methyltransferase activity in vivo and that this activity is directed against Lys(9) of histone H3. Two characterized repression domains of MeCP2 are involved in tethering the histone methyltransferase to MeCP2. We asked if MeCP2 can deliver Lys(9) H3 methylation to the H19 gene, whose activity it represses. We show that the presence of MeCP2 on nucleosomes within the repressor region of the H19 gene (the differentially methylated domain) coincides with an increase in H3 Lys(9) methylation. Our data provide evidence that MeCP2 reinforces a repressive chromatin state by acting as a bridge between two global epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation and histone methylation.},

abstract = {The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta genes in Xenopus laevis are regulated by thyroid hormone in all organs of an animal during metamorphosis. This autoregulation appears to be critical for systematic transformations of different organs as a tadpole is transformed into a frog. To understand this autoregulation, we have previously identified a thyroid hormone response element in the hormone-dependent promoter of the X. laevis TRbetaA gene. We report here the detailed characterization of the promoter. We have now mapped the transcription start site and demonstrated the existence of an initiator element at the start site critical for promoter function. More important, our deletion and mutational experiments revealed a novel upstream DNA element that is located 125 base pairs upstream of the start site and that is essential for active transcription from the promoter. Promoter reconstitution experiments showed that this novel element does not function as an enhancer, but acts as a core promoter element, which, together with the initiator, directs accurate transcription from the promoter. Finally, we provide evidence for the existence of a protein(s) that specifically recognizes this element. Our studies thus demonstrate that the TRbetaA promoter has a unique organization consisting of an initiator and a novel upstream promoter element. Such an organization may be important for the ubiquitous but tissue-dependent temporal regulation of the gene by thyroid hormone during amphibian metamorphosis.},

abstract = {In the mammalian central nervous system, responsiveness to glucocorticoids is mediated by both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). These pharmacologically distinct receptors are believed to bind to common response elements as homodimers. We provide evidence that MR and GR can form a heterodimeric complex with DNA-binding and transactivation properties different from those of the respective homodimers. There was a high degree of cooperativity of MR and GR in binding to a glucocorticoid response element. Transient transfection of a neuroblastoma cell line revealed a transcriptional response pattern of coexpressed MR and GR distinct from that obtained by MR or GR alone. Our findings demonstrate that heterodimerization of MR and GR is a hitherto unrecognized principle for the transcriptional regulation of glucocorticoid-responsive genes in tissue coexpressing these receptors.},

abstract = {In vitro the mineralocorticoid receptor is non-specific and does not distinguish between aldosterone and cortisol. In vivo certain tissues with this receptor are aldosterone selective (eg, kidney and parotid) whereas others with the same receptor are not (eg, hippocampus and heart). Experiments in rats showed that 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (which converts cortisol to cortisone in man and corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the rat) was much more highly concentrated in aldosterone-selective tissues than in non-selective tissues. The localisation in the selective tissues was such that the enzyme could act as a paracrine or possibly an autocrine mechanism protecting the receptor from exposure to corticosterone. Autoradiographic studies showed that protection is lost when the enzyme is inhibited; 3H-corticosterone and 3H-aldosterone were bound to similar sites. These findings seem to explain why sodium retention, hypokalaemia, and hypertension develop in subjects with congenital deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD and those in whom the enzyme has been inhibited by liquorice.},

However, references to the thyroid gland and its diseases can be seen in the literature of ancient Greek, Indian and Egyptian medicine. Goiter has always been a disease of immense interest of the general population due to its widespread prevalence. It is one of the most common medical problems portrayed in ancient paintings. Owing to the lack of awareness and poor nutritious habits of the people in that era, diseases such as iodine deficiency goiter were common. Physicians, healers and philosophers had been attempting time and again until the 19(th) century to come up with explanations of the thyroid gland and provide a reasonable basis of its diseases. Although the discovery of thyroid gland, its structure, function and diseases has been accredited to modern scientists who presented their work mostly in the 19(th) and 20(th) century, it is of significance to note that much of what we discovered in the 19(th) and 20(th) century had already been known centuries ago. This review attempts to explain the knowledge of thyroid gland, its function and diseases as held by the people in the previous centuries; and how this knowledge evolved over the years to become what it is today.},

GRKO mice on a C57BL/6/129sv mixed genetic background show a variable phenotype, with 90\% of -/- mice dying at birth with respiratory insufficiency but 10\% of mutant mice surviving to maturity. To investigate the possibility of residual GR expression in surviving GRKO mice we have measured binding of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone in tissue extracts from adrenalectomized mice. High affinity binding of dexamethasone in protein extracts of liver, kidney, lung and brain from adult GRKO mice is found at levels 30-60\% those in wild-type mice, with heterozygotes (+/-) having intermediate levels. PCR and ribonuclease protection analysis showed comparable levels of GR mRNA on the 3' side of the gene-targeted insertional mutation in exon 2 of the GR gene, with almost no GR mRNA detected from exons 1 and 2 on the 5' side of the gene-targeted insertional mutation. Western blot analysis using a C-terminal specific GR antibody detects a 39 kDa GR fragment in extracts from adult GRKO mice. Despite the evidence for expression of a ligand-binding domain fragment of the glucocorticoid receptor these mice are profoundly glucocorticoid resistant, with elevated levels of plasma ACTH and corticosterone. Thymocytes from adult and fetal GRKO mice are resistant to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis and cultured fetal hepatocytes from GRKO mice are completely refractory to glucocorticoid induction of the gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. Thus although the surviving adult homozygous GRKO mice express a dexamethasone-binding GR fragment, their classic target tissues remain profoundly glucocorticoid insensitive.},

abstract = {Four structural domains are characteristic of the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The hinge (D) domain which is located between the DNA binding (C) domain and the ligand binding (EF) domain, is less conserved among the nuclear receptors. In this study, we investigated the effects of the D domain on receptor function with regard to ligand binding, protein-protein interaction and DNA recognition. We found that EF domain of TR lacked T3 binding activity and additional D domain was required for its ligand binding. Using pull down assays and two-hybrid assays, we also demonstrated that the EF domain of TR did not dimerize with TR or RXR in solution, while the DEF domain was able to homo-and heterodimerize with RXR. In contrast, the RXR EF domain alone was able to heterodimerize with TR. The D domain of TR is required but that of RXR is not necessary for the interaction. We further demonstrated that the D domain was required for receptor specific DNA recognition. The ABC domain of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and TR(DEF) chimeric receptor could not bind to VDR response element (VDRE). Addition of own D domain of VDR to the ABC domain enables the chimeric receptor to bind VDRE and transactivate. The D domain of TR cannot substitute for that of VDR in context of specific DNA recognition. These data suggest that the D domain is important to maintain the integrity of the functional structure of the nuclear receptors.},

In this study, a 25-base pair element that resides upstream of the mouse proliferin gene was examined; it conferred on linked promoters either positive or negative glucocorticoid regulation, depending upon physiological context. This sequence, denoted a "composite" glucocorticoid response element (GRE), was bound selectively in vitro both by the glucocorticoid receptor and by c-Jun and c-Fos, components of the phorbol ester-activated AP-1 transcription factor. Indeed, c-Jun and c-Fos served as selectors of hormone responsiveness: the composite GRE was inactive in the absence of c-Jun, whereas it conferred a positive glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun, and a negative glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun and relatively high levels of c-Fos. The receptor also interacted selectively with c-Jun in vitro. A general model for composite GRE action is proposed that invokes both DNA binding and protein-protein interactions by receptor and nonreceptor factors.},

abstract = {We report here the detailed analysis of the promoter of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR) gene that is regulated by the hormone itself. The receptor gene, TR beta A, is one of the two TR beta genes in Xenopus laevis. It has two transcription start sites. The mRNAs derived from one of them are up-regulated by thyroid hormone, whereas those derived from the other are independent of the hormone. We have characterized the hormone-inducible promoter using a transient transfection assay in a Xenopus tissue culture cell line (A6). Deletion and mutational analysis identifies the first amphibian thyroid hormone response element (TRE). This TRE consists of near perfect direct repeats of AGGTCA with a 4-base pair spacing similar to mammalian TREs. The TRE forms specific complexes with extracts of A6 cells that have similar sequence specificities as those found for the complexes between mammalian TRs and TREs. However, unlike TREs found in other thyroid hormone-inducible promoters, this TRE is located at the putative transcription start site and mediates transcriptional repression by unliganded TRs. The addition of thyroid hormone at physiological concentrations overcomes the repression and induces further transcriptional activation at higher concentrations. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the regulation of amphibian metamorphosis, a process that is entirely controlled by thyroid hormone.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid steroid hormone cortisol is released by the adrenal glands in response to stress and serves as a messenger in circadian rhythms. Transcriptional responses to this hormonal signal are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We determined GR binding throughout the human genome by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA sequencing, and measured related changes in gene expression with mRNA sequencing in response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). We identified 4392 genomic positions occupied by the GR and 234 genes with significant changes in expression in response to DEX. This genomic census revealed striking differences between gene activation and repression by the GR. While genes activated with DEX treatment have GR bound within a median distance of 11 kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS), the nearest GR binding for genes repressed with DEX treatment is a median of 146 kb from the TSS, suggesting that DEX-mediated repression occurs independently of promoter-proximal GR binding. In addition to the dramatic differences in proximity of GR binding, we found differences in the kinetics of gene expression response for induced and repressed genes, with repression occurring substantially after induction. We also found that the GR can respond to different levels of corticosteroids in a gene-specific manner. For example, low doses of DEX selectively induced PER1, a transcription factor involved in regulating circadian rhythms. Overall, the genome-wide determination and analysis of GR:DNA binding and transcriptional response to hormone reveals new insights into the complexities of gene regulatory activities managed by GR.},

abstract = {Food availability and pond desiccation are two of the most studied factors that condition amphibian metamorphosis. It is well known that, when food is abundant, organisms undergo metamorphosis early and when they are relatively large. The capability of anurans to accelerate their developmental rate in response to desiccation is also common knowledge. These two variables must act together in nature, since we know that, as a pond dries, the per capita resources decrease. We conduct an experiment to evaluate the effects of desiccation and food availability separately and in combination in tadpoles of the painted frog (Discoglossus pictus). We demonstrate that food deprivation leads to slow growth rates, which delay metamorphosis and produce smaller size and weight. The capability to accelerate metamorphosis when facing a drying pond is also confirmed, but, nevertheless, with factor interaction (when the pool is drying and resources are scarce) the capacity to respond to desiccation is lost. In addition, slow drying rates are shown to be stressful situations, but not enough to provoke a shortening of the larval period; in fact, the larval period becomes longer. We also demonstrate that the interaction of these factors changes the allometric relationship of different parts of the hind limb, which has implications for the biomechanics of jumping. Due to low mortality rates and an adequate response to both environmental factors, we expect D. pictus to have a great invasive potential in its new Mediterranean distribution area, where lots of temporary and ephemeral ponds are present.},

Earlier studies showed that CS increase nuclear 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)) binding capacity in tadpole tail, and 5' deiodinase activity in tadpole tissues, increasing the generation of T(3) from thyroxine (T(4)). In the present study we investigated CS synergy with TH by analyzing expression of key genes involved in TH and CS signaling using tadpole tail explant cultures, prometamorphic tadpoles, and frog tissue culture cells (XTC-2 and XLT-15). Treatment of tail explants with T(3) at 100 nM, but not at 10 nM caused tail regression. Corticosterone (CORT) at three doses (100, 500 and 3400 nM) had no effect or increased tail size. T(3) at 10 nM plus CORT caused tails to regress similar to 100 nM T(3). Thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) mRNA was synergistically upregulated by T(3) plus CORT in tail explants, tail and brain in vivo, and tissue culture cells. The activating 5' deiodinase type 2 (D2) mRNA was induced by T(3) and CORT in tail explants and tail in vivo. Thyroid hormone increased expression of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNAs. Our findings support that the synergistic actions of TH and CS in metamorphosis occur at the level of expression of genes for TRbeta and D2, enhancing tissue sensitivity to TH. Concurrently, TH enhances tissue sensitivity to CS by upregulating GR and MR. Environmental stressors can modulate the timing of tadpole metamorphosis in part by CS enhancing the response of tadpole tissues to the actions of TH.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones are essential for normal mammalian development and for normal metabolism. Thyroxine (T4) is the principal product synthesized by the thyroid follicles, and triiodothyronine (T3), the biologically active hormone, derives mainly from tissue T4 deiodination. More than 99\% of the circulating hormone is bound to plasma proteins, mainly to thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin and albumin in man, and to transthyretin and albumin in rodents. The role of plasma proteins in the transport of hormones to target tissues has, for a long time, been controversial. The liver and the choroid plexus are the major sites of transthyretin synthesis, tissues from which transthyretin is secreted into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Transthyretin has been proposed to mediate thyroid hormone transfer into the tissues, particularly into the brain across the choroid-plexus-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Studies in a transthyretin-null mice strain have shown conclusively that transthyretin is not indespensable for thyroid hormones' entry into the brain and other tissues, nor for the maintenance of an euthyroid status. An euthyroid status is also observed in man totally deprived of thyroxine-binding globulin and in rats without albumin. Taken together, these results exclude dependence of thyroid hormone homeostasis on any major plasma carrier per se. This evidence agrees with the free hormone hypothesis which states that the biologically significant fraction, that is taken up by the tissues, is the free circulating hormone.},

abstract = {The adrenal glands are comprised of two distinct endocrine organs: the outer cortex, which is derived from mesoderm and synthesizes steroid hormones, and the inner medulla, which contains neuroectodermal cells derived from the neural crest and produces the catecholamine hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine. The developmental program that gives rise to the adrenal gland begins early during embryogenesis and continues throughout gestation and well after birth. In this article, we review the molecular mechanisms of adrenal differentiation and development, focusing on the contributions of genes responsible for the development of the adrenal cortex as identified from studies of experimental animal models and human subjects with clinical diseases. These studies identify a hierarchical network of transcription factors, including Wilms' tumor-1, steroidogenic factor-1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, X-linked-1, PBX1, and CITED2, that both give rise to the adrenal cortex and subsequently determine its subsequent function in steroidogenesis.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) modulate various physiological functions in many organ systems. The TR alpha and TR beta isoforms are products of 2 distinct genes, and the beta 1 and beta 2 isoforms are splice variants of the same gene. Whereas TR alpha 1 and TR beta 1 are widely expressed, expression of the TR beta 2 isoform is mainly limited to the pituitary, triiodothyronine-responsive TRH neurons, the developing inner ear, and the retina. Mice with targeted disruption of the entire TR beta locus (TR beta-null) exhibit elevated thyroid hormone levels as a result of abnormal central regulation of thyrotropin, and also develop profound hearing loss. To clarify the contribution of the TR beta 2 isoform to the function of the endocrine and auditory systems in vivo, we have generated mice with targeted disruption of the TR beta 2 isoform. TR beta 2-null mice have preserved expression of the TR alpha and TR beta 1 isoforms. They develop a similar degree of central resistance to thyroid hormone as TR beta-null mice, indicating the important role of TR beta 2 in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Growth hormone gene expression is marginally reduced. In contrast, TR beta 2-null mice exhibit no evidence of hearing impairment, indicating that TR beta 1 and TR beta 2 subserve divergent roles in the regulation of auditory function.},

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, real-time PCR, and immunoblotting, we investigated the ability of varying concentrations of corticosterone (CORT, the GC of rats) to modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-$\kappa$B (nuclear factor $\kappa$B), expression of anti- and proinflammatory factors and of the MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase family [ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), p38, and JNK/SAPK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase)], and AKT. In the frontal cortex, elevated CORT levels were proinflammatory, exacerbating LPS effects on NF-$\kappa$B, MAP kinases, and proinflammatory gene expression. Milder proinflammatory GCs effects occurred in the hippocampus. In the absence of LPS, elevated CORT levels increased basal activation of ERK1/2, p38, SAPK/JNK, and AKT in both regions. These findings suggest that GCs do not uniformly suppress neuroinflammation and can even enhance it at multiple levels in the pathway linking LPS exposure to inflammation.},

@article{Braun2013,
abstract = {An adverse early-life environment is associated with long-term disease consequences. Adversity early in life is hypothesized to elicit developmental adaptations that serve to improve fetal and postnatal survival and prepare the organism for a particular range of postnatal environments. These processes, although adaptive in their nature, may later prove to be maladaptive or disadvantageous if the prenatal and postnatal environments are widely discrepant. The exposure of the fetus to elevated levels of either endogenous or synthetic glucocorticoids is one model of early-life adversity that contributes substantially to the propensity of developing disease. Moreover, early-life glucocorticoid exposure has direct clinical relevance because synthetic glucocorticoids are routinely used in the management of women at risk of early preterm birth. In this regard, reports of adverse events in human newborns have raised concerns about the safety of glucocorticoid treatment; synthetic glucocorticoids have detrimental effects on fetal growth and development, childhood cognition, and long-term behavioral outcomes. Experimental evidence supports a link between prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids and alterations in fetal development and changes in placental function, and many of these alterations appear to be permanent. Because the placenta is the conduit between the maternal and fetal environments, it is likely that placental function plays a key role in mediating effects of fetal glucocorticoid exposure on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis development and long-term disease risk. Here we review recent insights into how the placenta responds to changes in the intrauterine glucocorticoid environment and discuss possible mechanisms by which the placenta mediates fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal development, metabolism, cardiovascular function, and reproduction.},

abstract = {Amphibian tadpoles display extensive anti-predator phenotypic plasticity, reducing locomotory activity and, with chronic predator exposure, developing relatively smaller trunks and larger tails. In many vertebrates, predator exposure alters activity of the neuroendocrine stress axis. We investigated predator-induced effects on stress hormone production and the mechanistic link to anti-predator defences in Rana sylvatica tadpoles. Whole-body corticosterone (CORT) content was positively correlated with predator biomass in natural ponds. Exposure to caged predators in mesocosms caused a reduction in CORT by 4 hours, but increased CORT after 4 days. Tadpoles chronically exposed to exogenous CORT developed larger tails relative to their trunks, matching morphological changes induced by predator chemical cue; this predator effect was blocked by the corticosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor metyrapone. Tadpole tail explants treated in vitro with CORT increased tissue weight, suggesting that CORT acts directly on the tail. Short-term treatment of tadpoles with CORT increased predation mortality, likely due to increased locomotory activity. However, long-term CORT treatment enhanced survivorship, likely due to induced morphology. Our findings support the hypothesis that tadpole physiological and behavioural/morphological responses to predation are causally interrelated. Tadpoles initially suppress CORT and behaviour to avoid capture, but increase CORT with longer exposure, inducing adaptive phenotypic changes.},

@article{Maia2011,
abstract = {Thyroid hormone is essential for the normal function of virtually all tissues. The iodothyronine deiodinases catalyze the removal of an iodine residue from the pro-hormone thyroxine (T(4)) molecule, thus producing either the active form triiodothyronine (T(3); activation) or inactive metabolites (reverse T(3); inactivation). Type I deiodinase (D1) catalyzes both reactions. Over the last years, several studies have attempted to understand the mechanisms of D1 function, underlying its effects on normal thyroid hormone metabolism and pathological processes. Although peripheral D1-generated T(3) production contributes to a portion of plasma T(3) in euthyroid state, pathologically increased thyroidal D1 activity seems to be the main cause of the elevated T(3) concentrations observed in hyperthyroid patients. On the other hand, D1-deficient mouse models show that, in the absence of D1, inactive and lesser iodothyronines are excreted in feces with the loss of associated iodine, demonstrating the scavenging function for D1 that might be particularly important in an iodine deficiency setting. Polymorphisms in the DIO1 gene have been associated with changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, whereas decreased D1 activity has been reported in the nonthyroid illness syndrome and in several human neoplasias. The current review aims at presenting an updated picture of the recent advances made in the biochemical and molecular properties of D1 as well as its role in human physiology.},

TH-induced metamorphosis requires alterations in the transcriptome and the proteome. However, only a few of the molecular components of this developmental program have been identified and their interrelationship remains unclear. Using a cDNA array comprised of 420 known anuran genes and quantitative PCR, we have identified 93 TH-responsive genes in the tail of premetamorphic tadpoles after exogenous administration of T3. Fifty-three of these mRNA transcripts have not previously been characterized as TH responsive in any species. The gene expression profiles show distinctive temporal patterns with most transcript steady-state levels increasing after induction of metamorphosis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total protein extracts from the tail shows changes in steady-state levels of many proteins after T3 treatment. Of the up-regulated proteins, 10 were identified by peptide mass mapping. These data identify potential components involved in the regulation of Xenopus tail regression by T3 and begin to address a critical question regarding the interrelationship between the transcriptome and the proteome in TH-dependent developmental processes.},

Fluorescent-labeled cDNA prepared from hepatic RNA of T3-treated and hypothyroid mice was hybridized to a cDNA microarray, representing 2225 different mouse genes, followed by computer analysis to compare relative changes in gene expression. Fifty five genes, 45 not previously known to be thyroid hormone-responsive genes, were found to be regulated by thyroid hormone. Among them, 14 were positively regulated by thyroid hormone, and unexpectedly, 41 were negatively regulated. The expression of 8 of these genes was confirmed by Northern blot analyses. Thyroid hormone affected gene expression for a diverse range of cellular pathways and functions, including gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, insulin signaling, adenylate cyclase signaling, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. This is the first application of the microarray technique to study hormonal regulation of gene expression in vivo and should prove to be a powerful tool for future studies of hormone and drug action.},

Several TR isoforms exist, and studies of null mice have identified some unique functions for individual TR variants, although considerable redundancy occurs, raising questions about the specificity of T(3) action. Thus, it is not known how diverse T(3) actions are regulated in target tissues that express multiple receptor variants. I have identified two novel TRbeta isoforms that are expressed widely and result from alternative mRNA splicing. TRbeta3 is a 44.6-kDa protein that contains an unique 23-amino-acid N terminus and acts as a functional receptor. TRDeltabeta3 is a 32.8-kDa protein that lacks a DNA binding domain but retains ligand binding activity and is a potent dominant-negative antagonist. The relative concentrations of beta3 and Deltabeta3 mRNAs vary between tissues and with changes in thyroid status, indicating that alternative splicing is tissue specific and T(3) regulated. These data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of T(3) action and define a new level of specificity that may regulate thyroid status in tissue.},

abstract = {Transcription of both Xenopus thyroid hormone receptor (TR) genes, xTR alpha and -beta, is strongly up-regulated by their own ligand T3 during natural or T3-induced metamorphosis of tadpoles and in some Xenopus cell lines. To explain this autoinduction, we analyzed the sequence of 1.6 kilobases of xTR beta promoter for putative T3-responsive elements. Two direct repeat +4 AGGTCA hexamer motifs (DR+4), an imperfect distal (-793/-778) and a perfect proximal (-5/11) site, a DR+1 site, and some possible half-sites were located in the 1.6-kilobase promoter. Transfection of Xenopus XTC-2 cells (which express xTR alpha and -beta) and XL-2 cells (which predominantly express TR alpha) with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs of deletion mutants and promoter fragments showed that the distal and proximal DR+4 sites responded to T3, although other flanking sequences may also play a role. The thyroid hormone-responsive element half-site present as DR+1 in the up-stream sequence at -1260/-950, when cloned in front of a heterologous promoter, functions independently. T3 enhanced transcription from the two DR+4-containing fragments when present together by only 2- to 3-fold due to a high basal activity. Overexpression of unliganded xTR alpha and xTR beta in XTC-2 cells repressed basal activity, which was then enhanced 7- to 4-fold by T3, respectively; with XL-2 cells cotransfected with xTR beta, T3 inducibility increased to 16-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with recombinant Xenopus TR alpha, TR beta, retinoid-X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha) and RXR gamma proteins showed that TR-RXR heterodimers, but not TR or RXR monomers or homodimers, strongly bound the natural and synthetic distal and proximal DR+4 elements in a ligand-independent manner. TR/RXR heterodimers exhibited the highest binding affinity for a 28-mer oligonucleotide probe for the -5/11 proximal DR+4 site, with only slight binding to DR+1 (retinoid-X-responsive element-like) site. The xTR beta promoter binding to XTC-2 cell nuclear extract suggested the in vivo relevance of the findings with recombinant TR/RXR heterodimers. It is concluded that xTR alpha and -beta proteins are capable of regulating the expression of xTR beta gene, which can explain its autoinduction seen during T3-induced metamorphosis.},

abstract = {Embryonic chickens (Day 18 of incubation) and 8-day-old posthatch chicks were subjected to an acute glucocorticoid challenge by a single iv injection of corticosterone (B), dexamethasone, or porcine adrenocorticotropin. Plasma samples were analyzed for changes in T4, T3, rT3, alpha-subunit, LH, GH, and B levels; iodothyronine deiodinase activity was measured in liver, kidney, and hypothalamus at several time points after injection. The effects of the different treatments were broadly similar within one age group, but differed clearly between pre- and post-hatch animals. In 18-day-old embryos glucocorticoids increased plasma T3 and decreased plasma T4, rT3, and the calculated TSH index, within hours after injection. These changes were accompanied by an immediate (1-4-24 hr after injection) decrease in hepatic inner ring deiodinating type III enzyme (IRD-III) activity and a delayed (24-48 hr after injection) increase in hepatic outer ring deiodinating type I enzyme (ORD-1) activity. Glucocorticoid challenge in 8-day-old chicks similarly decreased plasma T4 and the TSH index but tended to also lower plasma T3. Hepatic ORD-I activity decreased within 1 hr after injection, while the already very low hepatic IRD-III activity was for the most part unaffected. Acute increases in glucocorticoids lower thyroidal T4 secretion in both pre- and posthatch chickens but have clearly different effects on peripheral thyroid hormone deiodination and hence on circulating T3 at both developmental stages.},

abstract = {The dimer interface within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the steroid receptors stabilizes receptor binding to a palindromic DNA site termed a hormone response element (HRE) and is essential for receptor transcriptional activity when a single HRE drives transcription of a target gene. However, most steroid-responsive genes are driven by multiple HREs, and synergy between HREs is an important determinant of receptor activity. We have examined the effects of mutations within the DBD dimer interface on synergistic transcriptional activation by the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. As expected, mutations in either the mineralocorticoid receptor or glucocorticoid receptor that destabilized the DBD dimer interface disrupted receptor binding and activity at a single HRE. However, in striking contrast, these same mutations markedly increased receptor synergistic activity on a reporter gene containing multiple HREs and modestly increased DNA binding. Reestablishing intersubunit contacts by compensatory mutation or by coexpression of complementary mutants returned activity to near-wild type levels. These observations strongly suggest that the DBD dimer interface restrains steroid receptor transcriptional synergy and may play an unexpected role in the regulation of receptor activity.},

abstract = {Previous studies defined a DNA element necessary for glucocorticoid repression of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds this negative glucocorticoid response element (nGRE) with an in vitro affinity similar to that of GR for positive GREs. However, whereas GR binds GREs as homodimers, a novel GR complex which forms with nGRE appears to contain three GR molecules. Biochemical characterization of this complex as well as equilibrium binding studies suggest that it is formed by sequential binding of a GR homodimer followed by binding of a GR monomer on the opposite side of the double helix. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of GR is sufficient for differential binding of GRE and nGRE, as bacterially-expressed DBD formed unique nGRE complexes that contain three GR polypeptides. Thus, the POMC nGRE provides the first example of an interaction between GR and DNA in which GR binds otherwise than as a homodimer. Despite its high affinity for GR, the nGRE differs significantly from GREs in that it does not activate transcription in any context. As the nGRE appears insufficient on its own to confer hormone responsiveness, other POMC promoter elements are likely to be required to mediate glucocorticoid repression.},

Glucocorticoid production in the adult regulates carbohydrate and amino-acid metabolism, maintains blood pressure, and restrains the inflammatory response. In the fetus, exogenous glucocorticoids accelerate maturation of lung and gastrointestinal enzyme systems and promote hepatic glycogen deposition. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a 41-amino-acid neuropeptide produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and many regions of the cerebral cortex, has been implicated in both the HPA axis and behavioural responses to stress. To define the importance of CRH in the response of the HPA axis to stress and fetal development, we have constructed a mammalian model of CRH deficiency by targeted mutation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We report here that corticotropin-releasing hormone-deficient mice reveal a fetal glucocorticoid requirement for lung maturation. Postnatally, despite marked glucocorticoid deficiency, these mice exhibit normal growth, fertility and longevity, suggesting that the major role of glucocorticoid is during fetal rather than postnatal life.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR), when liganded to GC, activates transcription through direct binding to simple (+)GRE DNA binding sequences (DBS). GC-induced direct repression via GR binding to complex "negative" GREs (nGREs) has been reported. However, GR-mediated transrepression was generally ascribed to indirect "tethered" interaction with other DNA-bound factors. We report that GC-induces direct transrepression via the binding of GR to simple DBS (IR nGREs) unrelated to (+)GRE. These DBS act on agonist-liganded GR, promoting the assembly of cis-acting GR-SMRT/NCoR repressing complexes. IR nGREs are present in over 1000 mouse/human ortholog genes, which are repressed by GC in vivo. Thus variations in the levels of a single ligand can coordinately turn genes on or off depending in their response element DBS, allowing an additional level of regulation in GR signaling. This mechanism suits GR signaling remarkably well, given that adrenal secretion of GC fluctuates in a circadian and stress-related fashion.},

abstract = {Corticosteroids, the primary circulating vertebrate stress hormones, are known to potentiate the actions of thyroid hormone in amphibian metamorphosis. Environmental modulation of the production of stress hormones may be one way that tadpoles respond to variation in their larval habitat, and thus control the timing of metamorphosis. Thyroid hormone and corticosteroids act through structurally similar nuclear receptors, and interactions at the transcriptional level could lead to regulation of common pathways controlling metamorphosis. To better understand the roles of corticosteroids in amphibian metamorphosis we analyzed the developmental and hormone-dependent expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the brain (diencephalon), intestine and tail of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We compared the expression patterns of GR with expression of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta). In an effort to determine the relationship between nuclear hormone receptor expression and levels of ligand, we also analyzed changes in whole-body content of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxine, and corticosterone (CORT). GR transcripts of 8, 4 and 2 kb were detected in all tadpole tissues, but only the 4 and 2 kb transcripts could be detected in embryos. The level of GR mRNA was low during premetamorphosis in the brain but increased significantly during prometamorphosis, remained at a constant level throughout metamorphosis, and increased to its highest level in the juvenile frog. GR mRNA level in the intestine remained relatively constant, but increased in the tail throughout metamorphosis, reaching a maximum at metamorphic climax. The level of GR mRNA was increased by treatment with CORT in the intestine but not in the brain or tail. TRbeta mRNA level increased in the brain, intestine and tail during metamorphosis and was induced by treatment with T(3). Analysis of possible crossregulatory relationships between GRs and TRs showed that GR mRNA was upregulated by exogenous T(3) (50 nM) in the tail but downregulated in the brain of premetamorphic tadpoles. Exogenous CORT (100 nM) upregulated TRbeta mRNA in the intestine. Our findings provide evidence for tissue-specific positive, negative and crossregulation of nuclear hormone receptors during metamorphosis of X. laevis. The synergy of CORT with T(3) on tadpole tail resorption may depend on the accelerated accumulation of GR transcripts in this tissue during metamorphosis, which may be driven by rising plasma thyroid hormone titers.},

It has been recognized that methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins play an important role in interpreting the genetic information encoded by methylated DNA (mDNA). Although the function of MBD proteins has attracted considerable attention and is well characterized, the mechanism underlying mDNA recognition by MBD proteins is still poorly understood. In this article, we demonstrate that the methyl-CpG dinucleotides are recognized at the MBD-mDNA interface by two MBD arginines through an interplay of hydrogen bonding and cation-$\pi$ interaction. Through molecular dynamics and quantum-chemistry calculations we investigate the methyl-cytosine recognition process and demonstrate that methylation enhances MBD-mDNA binding by increasing the hydrophobic interfacial area and by strengthening the interaction between mDNA and MBD proteins. Free-energy perturbation calculations also show that methylation yields favorable contribution to the binding free energy for MBD-mDNA complex.},

These studies indicate that TRalpha1 is the predominant TR expressed in bone and that T(3) exerts anabolic actions during growth but catabolic actions in the adult skeleton. Examination of key skeletal regulatory pathways in TR mutant mice has identified GH, IGF-1 and fibroblast growth factor signalling and the Indian hedgehog/parathyroid hormone-related peptide feedback loop as major targets of T(3) action in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Nevertheless, although increased osteoclastic resorption is a major feature of thyrotoxic bone loss and altered osteoclast activity is central to the skeletal phenotype of TR mutant mice, it remains unclear whether T(3) has direct actions in osteoclasts. Detailed future analysis of the molecular mechanisms of T(3) action in bone will enhance our understanding of this emerging field and has the potential to identify novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.},

abstract = {Neonatal rats show a diminished response to stress [the stress-nonresponsive period (SNRP)] from day 2-3 until day 14 of age; the physiological bases for the SNRP are unknown. We examined whether enhanced sensitivity of the brain or pituitary to the inhibitory feedback effects of circulating glucocorticoids (GC) contributes to the SNRP. Age-related changes in the ability of corticosterone (CORT) and dexamethasone (DEX) to inhibit the ACTH secretion induced by urethane or CRF were studied. We also examined the ACTH response to ether stress or CRF in intact or 24 h-adrenalectomized 5-day-old rats. Plasma ACTH did not increase in intact rats after ether stress (basal: 64.6 +/- 9.1 pg/ml vs. stressed: 66.8 +/- 8.9 pg/ml; P greater than 0.05), whereas small elevations occurred after CRF challenge (184.6 +/- 40 pg/ml; P less than or equal to 0.01). Five-day-old adrenalectomized rats, which had elevated basal ACTH concentrations, increased ACTH secretion after exposure to ether or CRF. Thus, negative feedback appears to mediate critically the SNRP. Furthermore, sensitivity to such feedback was enhanced during the SNRP since the capacity of CORT to inhibit urethane-induced ACTH secretion in vivo declined with age; 1 mg/kg BW was the minimal dose that inhibited ACTH secretion at day 10, whereas at day 18, the threshold for a similar inhibition was 5 mg/kg BW. In contrast, at both ages, a dose of 10 micrograms/kg BW DEX inhibited ACTH release. In vitro dose response studies in whole pituitaries further demonstrated the enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GC feedback during the SNRP since the IC50 for CORT inhibition of CRF-induced ACTH release increased from days 3-5 to days 22-23. A similar, although not statistically significant trend was observed for DEX inhibition. Thus, neonatal rats exhibit an enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GC during the SNRP and removal of this inhibition allows ACTH secretion in response to ether stress.},

Whereas thyroid hormone receptor (TR) knockout and transgenic studies of mice have implicated TR involvement in mammalian development, the underlying molecular bases for the resulting phenotypes remain to be determined in vivo, especially considering that T3 is known to have both genomic, i.e., through TRs, and nongenomic effects on cells. Amphibian metamorphosis is an excellent model for studying the role of TR in vertebrate development because of its total dependence on T3. Here we investigated the role of TR in metamorphosis by developing a dominant positive mutant thyroid hormone receptor (dpTR). In the frog oocyte transcription system, dpTR bound a T3-responsive promoter and activated the promoter independently of T3. Transgenic expression of dpTR under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter in premetamorphic tadpoles led to precocious metamorphic transformations. Molecular analyses showed that dpTR induced metamorphosis by specifically binding to known T3 target genes, leading to increased local histone acetylation and gene activation, similar to T3-bound TR during natural metamorphosis. Our experiments indicated that the metamorphic role of T3 is through genomic action of the hormone, at least on the developmental parameters tested. They further provide the first example where TR is shown to mediate directly and sufficiently these developmental effects of T3 in individual organs by regulating target gene expression in these organs.},

abstract = {Rett syndrome (RTT, MIM 312750) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females, with an incidence of 1 in 10,000-15,000 (ref. 2). Patients with classic RTT appear to develop normally until 6-18 months of age, then gradually lose speech and purposeful hand use, and develop microcephaly, seizures, autism, ataxia, intermittent hyperventilation and stereotypic hand movements. After initial regression, the condition stabilizes and patients usually survive into adulthood. As RTT occurs almost exclusively in females, it has been proposed that RTT is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation with lethality in hemizygous males. Previous exclusion mapping studies using RTT families mapped the locus to Xq28 (refs 6,9,10,11). Using a systematic gene screening approach, we have identified mutations in the gene (MECP2 ) encoding X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the cause of some cases of RTT. MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A (refs 12,13). In 5 of 21 sporadic patients, we found 3 de novo missense mutations in the region encoding the highly conserved methyl-binding domain (MBD) as well as a de novo frameshift and a de novo nonsense mutation, both of which disrupt the transcription repression domain (TRD). In two affected half-sisters of a RTT family, we found segregation of an additional missense mutation not detected in their obligate carrier mother. This suggests that the mother is a germline mosaic for this mutation. Our study reports the first disease-causing mutations in RTT and points to abnormal epigenetic regulation as the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RTT.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (T(3)) induces gene regulation programs necessary for tadpole metamorphosis. Among the earliest responses to T(3) are the up-regulation of T(3) receptor beta (TRbeta; autoinduction) and BTEB1 (basic transcription element-binding protein 1). BTEB1 is a member of the Kr\"{u}ppel family of transcription factors that bind to GC-rich regions in gene promoters. The proximal promoter of the Xenopus laevis TrbetaA gene has seven GC-rich sequences, which led us to hypothesize that BTEB1 binds to and regulates TrbetaA. In tadpoles and the frog fibroblast-derived cell line XTC-2, T(3) up-regulated Bteb1 mRNA with faster kinetics than TrbetaA, and Bteb1 mRNA correlated with increased BTEB1 protein expression. BTEB1 bound to GC-rich sequences in the proximal TrbetaA promoter in vitro. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that BTEB1 associates with the TrbetaA promoter in vivo in a T(3) and developmental stage-dependent manner. Induced expression of BTEB1 in XTC-2 cells caused accelerated and enhanced autoinduction of the TrbetaA gene. This enhancement was lost in N-terminal truncated mutants of BTEB1. However, point mutations in the zinc fingers of BTEB1 that destroyed DNA binding did not alter the activity of the protein on TrbetaA autoinduction, suggesting that BTEB1 can function in this regard through protein-protein interactions. Our findings support the hypothesis that BTEB1 associates with the TrbetaA promoter in vivo and enhances autoinduction, but this action does not depend on its DNA binding activity. Cooperation among the protein products of immediate early genes may be a common mechanism for driving developmental signaling pathways.},

abstract = {The Thrb gene, encoding thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta), serves key roles in endocrine regulation and the development of the senses of hearing and color vision. The versatile functions of this gene depend upon its expression of distinct receptor isoforms by differential promoter activation. The TRbeta2 isoform has a particularly specialized distribution including in the anterior pituitary and cochlea. TRbeta2 is also found in immature cone photoreceptors where it has a unique role in programming the expression pattern of opsin photopigments that mediate color vision. Given the importance of precise, tissue-specific expression for the function of TRbeta2, we investigated the genomic control elements that direct this expression in vivo using lacZ reporter transgenes in mice. The TRbeta2 promoter region is sufficient for cochlear expression, whereas a complex intron control region is necessary for pituitary and retinal expression. In the retina, the intron region directs peak expression in the embryo in postmitotic, immature cones. The retinal control region is further subdivided into domains that specify and amplify expression, respectively, indicating that timely, cone-specific expression reflects an integrated response to complex signals. The mammalian Thrb gene has therefore incorporated several mechanisms into a multifunctional intron control region that regulates developmental induction of the distant promoter. This specialized genomic organization underlies the unique expression pattern and functions of TRbeta2.},

abstract = {Retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors preferentially activate target genes through response elements that consist of direct repeat arrangements of a core recognition motif of consensus sequence AGGTCA. We present evidence that the preference for direct repeat elements arises from two fundamental differences from steroid hormone receptors. First, retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors are demonstrated to preferentially form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors. These interactions are mediated by the carboxy-terminal dimerization interface, with heterodimer preference specified by actions of the DNA-binding domain. Second, the DNA-binding domains of heterodimeric receptors appear to be rotationally flexible with respect to the carboxy-terminal dimerization interface. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that, relative to the retinoid X and steroid hormone receptors, the DNA-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor is preferentially rotated by approximately 180 degrees with respect to its carboxy-terminal dimerization interface. As a result, solution interactions between the carboxy-terminal dimerization interfaces of the retinoid X and thyroid hormone receptors are predicted to lead to the preferential alignment of their respective DNA-binding domains in a direct repeat configuration. This alignment would position the retinoid X receptor over the upstream recognition motif of direct repeat response elements. Differential orientations of the DNA-binding domain, which contribute to the polarity of heterodimer binding, are regulated by a short sequence (the A box) that is located between the conserved DNA-binding and carboxy-terminal dimerization domains.},

abstract = {Interleukin-17 (IL-17) has emerged as a central player in the mammalian immune system. Although this cytokine exerts a host-defensive role in many infectious diseases, it promotes inflammatory pathology in autoimmunity and other settings. A myriad of studies have focused on how IL-17-producing cells are generated. However, the means by which IL-17 achieves its effects, either for the benefit or the detriment of the host, are due in large part to the induction of new gene expression. Whereas many IL-17 target genes are common to different disease states, in some cases the effects of IL-17 differ depending on the target cell, infectious site or pathogen. Gene products induced by IL-17 include cytokines (IL-6, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, tumour necrosis factor-alpha), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, among many others), inflammatory effectors (acute-phase protesins, complement) and antimicrobial proteins (defensins, mucins). Different cell types appear to respond differently to IL-17 in terms of target gene expression, with notable differences seen in mesenchymal and epithelial cells compared with cells of haematopoietic origin. Here, we summarize the major IL-17 target genes that mediate this cytokine's activities in both autoimmune and chronic diseases as well as during various types of infections.},

abstract = {Actin depolymerization specifically blocks the rapid thyroid hormone-dependent inactivation of type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. Thyroid hormone appears to regulate enzyme inactivation by modulating actin-mediated internalization of this plasma membrane-bound protein. In this study, we examined the interrelationships between thyroxine-dependent enzyme inactivation and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured astrocytes. Steady-state enzyme levels were inversely related to actin content in dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated astrocytes, and increases in filamentous actin resulted in progressively shorter enzyme half-lives without affecting enzyme synthesis. In the absence of thyroxine, filamentous actin decreased by approximately 40\% and soluble actin correspondingly increased; thyroxine normalized filamentous actin levels without changing total cell actin. Thyroxine treatment for only 10 min resulted in an approximately 50\% loss of enzyme and increased filamentous actin 2-fold. Neither cycloheximide nor actinomycin D affected the thyroxine-induced actin polymerization. Astrocytes grown without thyroxine also showed a disorganized actin cytoskeleton, and 10 nM thyroxine or 10 nM reverse triiodothyronine normalized the actin cytoskeleton appearance within 20 min; 10 nM 3,3',5-triiodothyronine had no effect. These data show that thyroxine modulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in astrocytes and suggest that regulation of actin polymerization may contribute to thyroid hormone's influence on arborization, axonal transport, and cell-cell contact in the developing brain.},

We determined the distribution of TR beta 2 protein in selected adult and fetal rat tissues using three anti-TR beta 2 antisera directed to different amino acid sequences of the distinctive A/B domain of TR beta 2. The proportion of total nuclear binding capacity cleared by each antiserum was determined by saturation analysis. 10-20\% of total binding capacity in adult brain, liver, kidney, and heart was immunoprecipitated by each antiserum. Use of specific antibodies to TR beta 1 and TR alpha 1 showed these isoforms accounted for the remainder of total T3 binding. Fetal liver and brain, however, contained only TR alpha 1. Immunohistochemical analysis of the adult tissues showed TR beta 2 present in nuclei. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detected low levels of TR beta 2 mRNA in the adult tissues.

Since excess cortisol in men and other mammals and excess corticosterone in rodents cause physiological abnormalities including abnormal testicular function, it was pertinent to study the cellular distribution of 11 beta-dehydrogenase in the testis. Purified antiserum directed against homogeneous rat 11 beta-dehydrogenase was used to localize the enzyme in the developing rat testis. With immunofluorescence, the enzyme was not detectable in fetal testis or in the testis of young male rats until the 26th day of development. A few interstitial cells were stained in the testis of 26-day-old animals. In the testis of 31-day-old rats many cells in the interstitium were positive. In adult animals the entire interstitial region displayed bright fluorescence. Depleting animals of germ cells did not abolish the fluorescence. The appearance of this enzyme correlates temporally with the postnatal increase in Leydig cell number and the developmental rise in serum testosterone. We suggest that 11 beta-dehydrogenase of Leydig cells protects the testis from the deleterious effects of cortisol.},

abstract = {The evolution of novelty in tightly integrated biological systems, such as hormones and their receptors, seems to challenge the theory of natural selection: it has not been clear how a new function for any one part (such as a ligand) can be selected for unless the other members of the system (e.g., a receptor) are already present. Here I show-based on identification and phylogenetic analysis of steroid receptors in basal vertebrates and reconstruction of the sequences and functional attributes of ancestral proteins-that the first steroid receptor was an estrogen receptor, followed by a progesterone receptor. Genome mapping and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the full complement of mammalian steroid receptors evolved from these ancient receptors by two large-scale genome expansions, one before the advent of jawed vertebrates and one after. Specific regulation of physiological processes by androgens and corticoids are relatively recent innovations that emerged after these duplications. These findings support a model of ligand exploitation in which the terminal ligand in a biosynthetic pathway is the first for which a receptor evolves; selection for this hormone also selects for the synthesis of intermediates despite the absence of receptors, and duplicated receptors then evolve affinity for these substances. In this way, novel hormone-receptor pairs are created, and an integrated system of increasing complexity elaborated. This model suggests that ligands for some "orphan" receptors may be found among intermediates in the synthesis of ligands for phylogenetically related receptors.},

abstract = {The number of functional hormone receptors expressed by a cell in large part determines its responsiveness to the hormonal signal. The regulation of hormone receptor gene expression is therefore a central component of hormone action. Vertebrate steroid and thyroid hormones act by binding to nuclear receptors (NR) that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Nuclear receptor genes are regulated by diverse and interacting intracellular signaling pathways. Nuclear receptor ligands can regulate the expression of the gene for the NR that mediates the hormone's action (autoregulation), thus influencing how a cell responds to the hormone. Autoregulation can be either positive or negative, the hormone increasing or decreasing, respectively, the expression of its own NR. Positive autoregulation (autoinduction) is often observed during postembryonic development, and during the ovarian cycle, where it enhances cellular sensitivity to the hormonal signal to drive the developmental process. By contrast, negative autoregulation (autorepression) may become important in the juvenile and adult for homeostatic negative feedback responses. In addition to autoregulation, a NR can influence the expression other types of NRs (cross-regulation), thus modifying how a cell responds to a different hormone. Cross-regulation by NRs is an important means to temporally coordinate cell responses to a subsequent (different) hormonal signal, or to allow for crosstalk between hormone signaling pathways.},

@article{Laurberg1984,
abstract = {In subjects with normal thyroid function only a minor part of firculating 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) originates directly from the thyroid; the majority is produced in the peripheral tissues by deiodination of thyroxine (T4). However, T3 of thyroidal origin constitutes a relatively high fraction of the total T3 produced in many patients with thyroid hyperfunction or hypofunction. Such a relatively high T3 content in the secretion of the thyroid could be caused by a low T4/T3 ratio in thyroglobulin. Severe iodine deficiency is a well-known inducer of a low T4/T3 ratio, but a low T4/T3 ratio can also be produced independent of the iodine content. This is seen in in vitro studies of thyroglobulin iodination when small amounts of DIT are added to the incubation mixture and in vivo in TSH-treated animals and in patients with Graves' disease. Another mechanism for high thyroidal secretion of T3 could be an enhanced fractional deiodination of T4 to T3 in the thyroid. In vitro thyroid perfusion studies have shown that the T3 content of thyroid secretions is higher than would be expected from the T4/T3 ratio of thyroid hydrolysate and that the major mechanism is deiodination of T4 to T3. Thyroxine deiodinases are also present in the human thyroid, and the amount of T4 deiodinase is enhanced in the thyroids from patients with medically treated Graves' disease and in the hyperstimulated thyroids of rats. Other factors of possible importance for the mixture of T3 and T4 secreted by the thyroid are a relatively faster liberation of T3 than of T4 from thyroglobulin during partial hydrolysis (this faster release of T3 is probably the mechanism behind the more "rapid" secretion of T3 than of T4), or some kind of thyroid heterogeneity leading to pinocytosis and hydrolysis of thyroglobulin with a lower T4/T3 ratio than that of average thyroglobulin.},

We found that while its mRNA level varies little in whole animals during development, the expression of CTHBP is inversely correlated with tissue-specific transformations during metamorphosis. A high level of its mRNA was observed in the tail of premetamorphic tadpoles. However, the expression is dramatically repressed with the onset of rapid tail resorption. In the hindlimb, the expression of CTHBP is very low during morphogenesis. Subsequently, its expression continuously increases during the period of limb growth. In contrast, a low level of CTHBP expression was detected in the intestine throughout metamorphosis. These results suggest that CTHBP could function to modulate the metamorphic process by regulating the level of intracellular thyroid hormones.},

abstract = {The administration of exogenous iodides (saturated solution of potassium iodide, SSKI) to normal male volunteers resulted in a significant decrease in the serum concentration of thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) and a significant increase in serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH). During the control period (phase I), serum concentrations of T(4) averaged 6.9+/-1.8 mug/100 ml (mean +/-SD), T(3) 106+/-15 ng/100 ml, and TSH 3.7+/-1.3 muU/ml. During the administration of 1 drop of SSKI twice daily for 11 days (phase II), there was a small but significant decrease in the serum concentration of T(4) and T(3) (5.8+/-1.6 mug/100 ml and 91+/-19 ng/100 ml, respectively) and a small but significant increase in the serum concentration of TSH (6.0+/-3.5 muU/ml). During the administration of 5 drops of SSKI twice daily (phase III) over the following 12-19 days, these changes persisted, except for a small increase in the serum concentration of T(3) (97+/-20 ng/100 ml), which was statistically significant when compared to values obtained during phase II. Values returned to control levels 14 days after withdrawal of SSKI. Almost all these observed changes took place within the limits of the normal range. It is postulated that, in euthyroid individuals, iodides specifically inhibit release of T(4) and probably of T(3). The resulting slight decrease in values for serum T(4) and T(3) elicits a small increase in TSH secretion which, it is postulated, antagonizes the inhibition of hormone release induced by iodides. As a result, a new equilibrium is reached which maintains the euthyroid state.},

abstract = {Acute and chronic stress sensitizes or "primes" the neuroinflammatory response to a subsequent pro-inflammatory challenge. While prior evidence shows that glucocorticoids (GCs) play a pivotal role in stress-induced potentiation of neuroinflammatory responses, it remains unclear whether stress-induced GCs sensitize the response of key CNS immune substrates (i.e. microglia) to pro-inflammatory stimuli. An ex vivo approach was used to address this question. Here, stress-induced GC signaling was manipulated in vivo and hippocampal microglia challenged with the pro-inflammatory stimulus LPS ex vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were either pretreated in vivo with the GC receptor antagonist RU486 or adrenalectomized (ADX). Animals were then exposed to an acute stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) and 24 h later hippocampal microglia were isolated and challenged with LPS to probe for stress-induced sensitization of pro-inflammatory responses. Prior exposure to IS resulted in a potentiated pro-inflammatory cytokine response (e.g. IL-1$\beta$ gene expression) to LPS in isolated microglia. Treatment in vivo with RU486 and ADX inhibited or completely blocked this IS-induced sensitization of the microglial pro-inflammatory response. The present results suggest that stress-induced GCs function to sensitize the microglial pro-inflammatory response (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, NF$\kappa$BI$\alpha$) to immunologic challenges.},

abstract = {Environments experienced by organisms during early development shape the character and timing of developmental processes, leading to different probabilities of survival in the developmental habitat, and often profound effects on phenotypic expression later in life. Amphibian larvae have immense capacity for plasticity in behavior, morphology, growth and development rate. This creates the potential for extreme variation in the timing of, and size at metamorphosis, and subsequent phenotype in the juvenile and adult stage. Hormones of the neuroendocrine stress axis play pivotal roles in mediating environmental effects on animal development. Corticotropin-releasing factor, whose secretion by hypothalamic neurons is induced by environmental stress, influences the timing of amphibian metamorphosis by controlling the activity of the thyroid and interrenal (adrenal; corticosteroids) glands. At target tissues, corticosteroids synergize with thyroid hormone to promote metamorphosis. Thus, environmental stress acts centrally to increase the activity of the two principle endocrine axes controlling metamorphosis, and the effectors of these axes synergize at the level of target tissues to promote morphogenesis. While stress hormones can promote survival in a deteriorating larval habitat, costs may be incurred such as reduced tadpole growth and size at metamorphosis. Furthermore, exposure to elevated corticosteroids early in life can cause permanent changes in the expression of genes of the neuroendocrine stress axis, leading to altered physiology and behavior in the juvenile/adult stage. Persistent effects of stress hormone actions early in life may have important fitness consequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: IL-10 plays an immunosuppressive role in inflammatory responses. Increased plasma levels of IL-10 have been detected in patients under glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, indicating that steroids may exert their suppressive effect, in part, by increasing IL-10 production.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to define possible mechanisms by which steroids up-regulate IL-10 production. To this end, we have analysed ex vivo the effect of GCs on the constitutive production of IL-10 by lymphocytes and cells of myeloid origin.

METHODS: Monocytes and T cells were isolated by a Percoll gradient and B cells were purified by rosetting. Protein and mRNA IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA and by Northern blot, respectively.

RESULTS: Monocytes, but not T or B cells, up-regulated the constitutive production of IL-10 following pre-treatment for at least 12 h with physiological doses of dexamethasone (Dex). Up-regulation of IL-10 occurred at both protein and mRNA levels, probably indicating that the effect of Dex was by incrementing gene transcription. Other steroids had similar outcomes, their effects being dose-related, proportional to the steroid potency and totally reversed by the steroid antagonist RU486. Thus, transcript levels of IL-10 were up-regulated by GCs probably through binding of the GC receptor to its specific glucocorticoid response element sequence in the IL-10 promoter. In contrast to monocytes, differentiated immature macrophages and dendritic cells did not vary their constitutive IL-10 production after pre-treatment with Dex.

CONCLUSION: Our results support the fact that steroids up-regulate constitutive IL-10 production by selectively triggering activation signals on monocytes.},

Traditionally, these binding sites have been viewed only as docking sites. Using structural, biochemical, and cell-based assays, we show that GR binding sequences, differing by as little as a single base pair, differentially affect GR conformation and regulatory activity.

Much effort has been made to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns. However, little is known about genome-wide variation of DNA methylation patterns. In this study, we introduced the concept of methylation entropy, a measure of the randomness of DNA methylation patterns in a cell population, and exploited it to assess the variability in DNA methylation patterns of Alu repeats and promoters. A few interesting observations were made: (i) within a cell population, methylation entropy varies among genomic loci; (ii) among cell populations, the methylation entropies of most genomic loci remain constant; (iii) compared to normal tissue controls, some tumors exhibit greater methylation entropies; (iv) Alu elements with high methylation entropy are associated with high GC content but depletion of CpG dinucleotides and (v) Alu elements in the intronic regions or far from CpG islands are associated with low methylation entropy. We further identified 12 putative allelic-specific methylated genomic loci, including four Alu elements and eight promoters. Lastly, using subcloned normal fibroblast cells, we demonstrated the highly variable methylation patterns are resulted from low fidelity of DNA methylation inheritance.},

abstract = {The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) classically mediates aldosterone effects on salt homeostasis and blood pressure regulation in epithelial target tissues. In recent years, functional MRs have been identified in non classical targets of aldosterone actions, in particular in adipose tissue, where they mediate the effects of aldosterone and glucocorticoids in the control of adipogenesis, adipose expansion and its pro-inflammatory capacity. In this context, inappropriate MR activation has been demonstrated to be a causal factor in several pathologic conditions such as vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and obesity. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest developments in this rapidly developing field, and will focus on the role of MR and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as potential leading characters in the early steps of adipocyte dysfunction and obesity. Indeed modulation of MR activity in adipose tissue has promise as a novel therapeutic approach to treat obesity and its related metabolic complications.

abstract = {The mRNA level of the two Xenopus laevis thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) genes is up-regulated in tadpoles and cultured cells by the addition of thyroid hormone (TH). Up-regulation of transcripts of the 5' most exon is detectable 2-3 h before that of full-length TR beta mRNA, strongly suggesting that up-regulation is under transcriptional control. The TH-induced up-regulation in cultured cells is inhibited by cycloheximide when measured either by a transcription initiation assay that measures transcripts of the 5' most exon or by synthesis of full-length TR beta mRNA. From this we conclude that in cultured cells protein synthesis is required for up-regulation of TR beta mRNA. The up-regulation of TR beta mRNA by TH in tadpoles is only partially inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. A survey of "thyroid response" genes in the literature reveals that the reported change in gene expression is, in most cases, sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition. This is true of genes with demonstrable thyroid hormone response elements. If an unknown protein must be synthesized to effect up-regulation of a thyroid hormone response gene, it calls into question assays that only take into account the binary reaction between thyroid hormone receptor and a putative thyroid hormone response element.},

abstract = {Recruitment to activated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors of Grb2 and p21(ras) leads to downstream activation of the kinases Raf, MAPK/Erk kinase (Mek) and, subsequently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Activated Erk phosphorylates specific serine residues within cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), promoting enzyme translocation to membranes and facilitating liberation of arachidonic acid (AA). In the A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line dexamethasone inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) activation and AA release by blocking the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated EGF receptor (EGF-R) through a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent (RU486-sensitive), transcription-independent (actinomycin-insensitive), mechanism. The dexamethasone-induced block of Grb2 recruitment was parallelled by changes in phosphorylation status and subcellular localization of lipocortin 1 (LC1) and an increase in the amount of the tyrosine phosphoprotein co-localized with EGF-R. Like dexamethasone, peptides containing E-Q-E-Y-V from the N-terminal domain of LC1 also blocked ligand-induced association of Grb2, p21(ras) and Raf. Our results point to an unsuspected rapid effect of glucocorticoids, mediated by occupation of GR but not by changes in gene transcription, which is brought about by competition between LC1 and Grb2 leading to a failure of recruitment off signalling factors to EGF-R},

abstract = {RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is bound to the promoter regions of many or most developmental control genes before their activation during Drosophila embryogenesis. It has been suggested that Pol II stalling is used to produce dynamic and rapid responses of developmental patterning genes to transient cues such as extracellular signaling molecules. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental analysis of stalled promoters to determine how they come to bind Pol II in the early Drosophila embryo. At least one-fourth of the stalled promoters contain a shared sequence motif, the "pause button" (PB): KCGRWCG. The PB motif is sometimes located in the position of the DPE, and over one-fifth of the stalled promoters contain the following arrangement of core elements: GAGA, Inr, PB, and/or DPE. This arrangement was used to identify additional stalled promoters in the Drosophila genome, and permanganate footprint assays were used to confirm that the segmentation gene engrailed contains paused Pol II as seen for heat-shock genes. We discuss different models for Pol II binding and gene activation in the early embryo.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (T3) is essential for normal development, differentiation and metabolic balance. We have performed DNA microarray experiments using hepatic RNA from hypothyroid and T3-treated hypothyroid rats in order to characterize T3-induced gene expression patterns after various time points (6, 24 and 48 h after the administration of the hormone). Sixty-two of 4608 different genes displayed a reproducible T3-response, and cluster analysis divided these differentially regulated genes into six expression patterns. Thirty-six genes were not significantly regulated within the first 24 h. Transient transfection experiments of eight late-induced gene promoters failed to detect a thyroid hormone response element within their regulatory elements, suggesting an indirect activation mechanism(s). In search for an intermediate factor of T3 action, we examined whether various rather ubiquitous transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and coactivators of the PPARgamma coactivator 1 family (PGC-1) are regulated by T3. Only PPARgamma and PERC/PGC-1beta exhibit a significant T3-response within the first 6 h after treatment, identifying these factors as candidate components for mediating the late-induced expression pattern. Regulation of early-induced genes within the first 6 h after administration of T3 on transcript levels correlates with altered protein levels after 24 and 48 h in vivo.},

abstract = {The thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) receptor (T3R) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. T3Rs are known to bind as homodimers and heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to two hexameric half-sites in directly repeated, palindromic, and inverted palindromic orientations. The binding of T3R monomers to individual half-sites was often reported, but no clear ligand-induced transactivational activity has been shown. Here, we analyzed interactions of T3R monomers with individual half-sites of the sequence NNAGGTCA. We found that the two nucleotides 5' of the AGGTCA core half-site strongly influence T3R binding and transcriptional activity: octameric half-sites of the consensus sequence (T/C)(A/G)AGGTCA were bound by T3Rs with the highest affinity. This suggests T3R functioning also as a monomeric transcription factor like the orphan nuclear receptors NGFI-B and FTZ-F1. Moreover, we observed that the function of T3R-RXR heterodimers on response elements composed of two half-sites in a directly repeated orientation spaced by 4 nucleotides is determined in major parts by the 5'-flanking sequence of the upstream half-site. Consequently, we noted that the affinity of T3R homodimers is influenced by both 5'-flanking sequences. Our findings suggest that the binding of dimerizing receptors like T3R and other nuclear receptors to their cognate response elements is determined not only by the half-site core sequence, orientation, and number of spacing nucleotides, but also by the nucleotide sequence preceding the half-sites.},

abstract = {The intrauterine environment is a major contributor to normal physiological growth and development of an individual. Disturbances at this critical time can affect the long-term health of the offspring. Low birth weight individuals have strong correlations with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later-life. These observations led to the Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis which suggested that these associations arose because of the response of a growing fetus to a suboptimal environment such as poor nutrition. Animal models have shown that environmentally induced intrauterine growth restriction increases the risk of a variety of diseases later in life. These detrimental features are also observed in high birth weight offspring from mothers who were obese or consumed a high fat diet during gestation. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have elucidated several potential candidates for the long-term effects of the early environment on the function and metabolism of a cell. These include: (1) Epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNA methylation and histone modifications), which regulate specific gene expression and can be influenced by the environment, both during gestation and early postnatal life and (2) Oxidative stress that changes the balance between reactive oxygen species generation (e.g. through mitochondrial dysfunction) and antioxidant defense capacity. This has permanent effects on cellular ageing such as regulation of telomere length. Further understanding of these processes will help in the development of therapeutic strategies to increase healthspan and reduced the burden of age-associated diseases.},

UHRF1 colocalizes with the maintenance DNA methyltransferase protein DNMT1 throughout S phase. UHRF1 appears to tether DNMT1 to chromatin through its direct interaction with DNMT1. Furthermore UHRF1 contains a methyl DNA binding domain, the SRA (SET and RING associated) domain, that shows strong preferential binding to hemimethylated CG sites, the physiological substrate for DNMT1. These data suggest that UHRF1 may help recruit DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA to facilitate faithful maintenance of DNA methylation.},

abstract = {Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is an innate response that leads to adaptive immunity to coadministered proteins. To begin to identify underlying mechanisms in intact lymphoid tissues, we studied alpha-galactosylceramide. This glycolipid activates innate Valpha14(+) natural killer T cell (NKT) lymphocytes, which drive DC maturation and T cell responses to ovalbumin antigen. Hours after giving glycolipid i.v., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma were released primarily by DCs. These cytokines induced rapid surface remodeling of DCs, including increased CD80/86 costimulatory molecules. Surprisingly, DCs from CD40(-/-) and CD40L(-/-) mice did not elicit CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell immunity, even though the DCs exhibited presented ovalbumin on major histocompatibility complex class I and II products and expressed high levels of CD80/86. Likewise, an injection of TNF-alpha up-regulated CD80/86 on DCs, but CD40 was required for immunity. CD40 was needed for DC interleukin (IL)-12 production, but IL-12p40(-/-) mice generated normal ovalbumin-specific responses. Therefore, the link between innate and adaptive immunity via splenic DCs and innate NKT cells has several components under distinct controls: antigen presentation in the steady state, increases in costimulatory molecules dependent on inflammatory cytokines, and a distinct CD40/CD40L signal that functions together with antigen presentation ("signal one") and costimulation ("signal two") to generate functioning CD4(+) T helper cell 1 and CD8(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes.},

abstract = {The structure of purified preparations of activated (DNA-binding) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was analyzed in the presence or absence of DNA. A 35-base pair DNA fragment harboring a strong GR-binding site from the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (-189/-166) was used for stoichiometric analysis of the GR.DNA complex. Glycerol gradient centrifugation was utilized in order to separate the 6 S GR.DNA complex from the 4 S GR and the 3 S DNA fragment. Synthetic glucocorticoid [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound to GR and 32P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragment were used as probes for quantitation of each component. Such experiments demonstrated that two hormone molecules (two 87.5-kDa GR peptides) are associated with each cognate DNA site. Quantitative DNase I footprinting confirmed this result. The formation of the GR.DNA complex was ligand-dependent, but once formed the complex remained stable after ligand dissociation. Incubation of GR with 0.01-0.1\% (w/v) glutaraldehyde resulted in a shift in its sedimentation rate from 4 to 6 S. Gel filtration chromatography of glutaraldehyde-treated GR resulted in a complex of slightly larger size than the gamma-globulin standard (158 kDa). Gel filtration of GR without glutaraldehyde treatment gave the identical result. This suggests that a GR multimer, probably a homodimer, is stable during gel filtration chromatography but needs to be stabilized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking or DNA during glycerol gradient centrifugation. We conclude that the activated GR exists as a homodimer when unbound as well as when bound to DNA.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (T(3)) influences cell proliferation, death and differentiation during development of the central nervous system (CNS). Hormone action is mediated by T(3) receptors (TR) of which there are two subtypes, TRalpha and TRbeta. Specific roles for TR subtypes in CNS development are poorly understood. We analyzed involvement of TRalpha and TRbeta in neural cell proliferation during metamorphosis of Xenopus laevis. Cell proliferation in the ventricular/subventricular neurogenic zones of the tadpole brain increased dramatically during metamorphosis. This increase was dependent on T(3) until mid-prometamorphosis, after which cell proliferation decreased and became refractory to T(3). Using double labeling fluorescent histochemistry with confocal microscopy we found TRalpha expressed throughout the tadpole brain, with strongest expression in proliferating cells. By contrast, TRbeta was expressed predominantly outside of neurogenic zones. To corroborate the histochemical results we transfected living tadpole brain with a Xenopus TRbeta promoter-EGFP plasmid and found that most EGFP expressing cells were not dividing. Lastly, treatment with the TRalpha selective agonist CO23 increased brain cell proliferation; whereas, treatment with the TRbeta-selective agonists GC1 or GC24 did not. Our findings support the view that T(3) acts to induce cell proliferation in the tadpole brain predominantly, if not exclusively, via TRalpha.},

abstract = {Parental care influences development across mammals. In humans such influences include effects on phenotypes, such as stress reactivity, which determine individual differences in the vulnerability for affective disorders. Thus, the adult offspring of rat mothers that show an increased frequency of pup licking/grooming (ie, high LG mothers) show increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and more modest hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress compared with the offspring of low LG mothers. In humans, childhood maltreatment associates decreased hippocampal GR expression and increased stress responses in adulthood. We review the evidence suggesting that such effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation across GR promoter regions. We also present new findings revealing associated histone post-translational modifications of a critical GR promoter in rat hippocampus. Taken together these existing evidences are consistent with the idea that parental influences establish stable phenotypic variation in the offspring through effects on intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the epigenetic state and function of specific regions of the genome.},

Compared with other epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation is thought to be relatively stable. Despite its role in long-term silencing, DNA methylation is more dynamic than originally thought as active DNA demethylation has been observed during specific stages of development. In the past decade, many enzymes have been proposed to carry out active DNA demethylation and growing evidence suggests that, depending on the context, this process may be achieved by multiple mechanisms. Insight into how DNA methylation is dynamically regulated will broaden our understanding of epigenetic regulation and have great implications in somatic cell reprogramming and regenerative medicine.},

@article{Tata2006,
abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) elicits multiple physiological actions in vertebrates from fish to man. These actions can be divided into two broad categories: those where the hormone regulates developmental processes and those that involve actions in the adult organism. Amphibian metamorphosis is a most dramatic example of extensive morphological, biochemical and cellular changes occurring during post-embryonic development, which is obligatorily initiated and sustained by TH. It is, therefore, an ideal model system to understand the action of the hormone. Each tissue of the frog tadpole responds differently to TH, ranging from altered gene expression, morphogenesis, tissue re-structuring and extensive cell death, according to a developmental programme set in place before the thyroid gland begins to secrete the hormone. The key element determining the response to the hormone is the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR). As in most vertebrates, there are two thyroid hormone receptors, TRalpha and TRbeta, which repress transcription in the absence of the ligand and whose concentration in the tissues is directly modulated by the hormone itself. In Xenopus, biochemical and in situ techniques have shown that the amount of TRbeta mRNA and protein are elevated 50-100 times during TH-induced metamorphic climax. This phenomenon of "autoinduction" of receptor is also seen with developmental or inductive processes regulated by other hormones acting through nuclear receptors. It is possible that receptor upregulation may be a pre-requisite for hormonal response. Recent molecular and cell biological studies have suggested that TRs function as multimeric complexes with other nuclear or chromatin proteins, such as co-repressors and co-activators, to regulate the structure of the chromatin, and thereby determine the transcription of the receptor-specified target gene. There is evidence that this may also be so for thyroid hormone regulated transcription during amphibian metamorphosis.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activates or represses transcription depending on the sequence and architecture of the glucocorticoid response elements in target genes and the availability and activity of interacting cofactors. Numerous GR cofactors have been identified, but they alone are insufficient to dictate the specificity of GR action. Furthermore, the role of different functional surfaces on the receptor itself in regulating its targets is unclear, due in part to the paucity of known target genes. Using DNA microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR, we identified genes transcriptionally activated by GR, in a translation-independent manner, in two human cell lines. We then assessed in U2OS osteosarcoma cells the consequences of individually disrupting three GR domains, the N-terminal activation function (AF) 1, the C-terminal AF2, or the dimer interface, on activation of these genes. We found that GR targets differed in their requirements for AF1 or AF2, and that the dimer interface was dispensable for activation of some genes in each class. Thus, in a single cell type, different GR surfaces were used in a gene-specific manner. These findings have strong implications for the nature of gene response element signaling, the composition and structure of regulatory complexes, and the mechanisms of context-specific transcriptional regulation.},

In amphibians, variation in the larval environment influences development and causes changes in post-metamorphic shape. We examined post-metamorphic consequences, both morphological and locomotory, of alterations in growth and development. We reared tadpoles of two phylogenetically and ecologically distant frog species (the red-eyed treefrog Agalychnis callidryas and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis) under different temperatures with ad libitum food supply and under different food levels at a constant temperature. Low temperature and low food levels both resulted in similarly extended larval periods. However, low temperature yielded relatively long-legged frogs with a lower degree of ossification than warm temperature, whereas low food yielded relatively short-legged frogs with a higher degree of ossification than high food levels. Such allometric differences had no effect on locomotor performance of juveniles. Our results provide a basis for understanding the relationship between growth, differentiation and post-metamorphic shape in anurans and help explain many of the discrepancies reported in previous studies.},

The aldo level first showed a significant peak at the beginning of the climax (St 58), and again at the middle of the climax (St 61-62); B level increased slightly but significantly at St 59, then showed an important peak at St 62-63. The high levels of these hormones at these stages seem to be associated with the concomitant surge of interrenal synthesis. At this stage, the plasma level of thyroid hormones is maximal, and the main morphological changes occur. Therefore, corticosteroids and thyroid hormones could have synergistic effects on morphogenesis. A relationship is assumed between the surge of corticosterone at the middle of the climax, and the glucocorticoid function of this hormone. Aldosterone could play a part in the differentiation of adult skin.},

abstract = {In order to examine the significance of differences in the triiodothyronine/thyroxine (T3/T4) ratio in the achievement of euthyroidism and in different thyroidal diseases, we studied 1050 subjects: 233 were euthyroid (Eu), 239 hypothyroid (Hypo) with initial TSH levels >15 mU/L, 273 hypothyroid on substitution therapy with L-thyroxine alone and TSH values of 0.35-3.5 mU/L, (hypoRx), 236 hyperthyroid (hyper) and 69 in the acute phase of subacute thyroiditis De Quervain's (DQ). The ratio of T3/T4 was calculated using the conventional values. Results: The values of T3/T4 ratio in the various categories were: Eu= 15.89, Hypo= 24.12, hyper= 19.57, hypoRx= 13.42, DQ= 15.16. The T3/T4 ratio was lower in the hypoRx group than in the EU group (P <0.001), although neither TSH values nor T3 values showed any differences between these two groups, whereas T4 levels were significantly higher in the hypoRx group (Eu= 7.99+/-1.46, hypoRx = 9.11+/-1.58, P< 0.001). The T3/T4 ratio in the DQ group was comparable to that of the Eu group, but significantly lower than the hyper group (P=0.95 between Eu and DQ, P<0.001 between DQ and hyper). Conclusions: These findings indicate that in hypothyroid patients, L-T4-replacement that is sufficient to maintain a normal serum TSH is accompanied by a serum T4 that is higher than in normal individuals and may not result in an appropriately normal serum T3 concentration. In Thyrotoxicosis, a ratio of total T3/T4 >18.9 suggests Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter whereas T3/T4 <16 suggests thyroiditis (subacute or silent).},

Stressors involving an immediate physiologic threat ('systemic' stressors) are relayed directly to the PVN, probably via brainstem catecholaminergic projections. By contrast, stressors requiring interpretation by higher brain structures ('processive' stressors) appear to be channeled through limbic forebrain circuits. Forebrain limbic sites connect with the PVN via interactions with GABA-containing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area and hypothalamus. Thus, final elaboration of processive stress responses is likely to involve modulation of PVN GABAergic tone. The functional and neuroanatomical data obtained suggest that disease processes involving inappropriate stress control involve dysfunction of processive stress pathways.},

abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is modified throughout life by integration of new adult-born neurons. Similarities in neuronal maturation during DG development and adult hippocampal neurogenesis suggest that genetically encoded intrinsic regulatory mechanisms underlying these temporally distinct processes are conserved and reused. Here, we identify a novel transcriptional regulator of dentate granule neuron maturation, Kr\"{u}ppel-like factor 9 (Klf-9). We show that Klf-9 expression is induced by neuronal activity and as dentate granule neurons functionally integrate in the developing and adult DG. During development, dentate granule neurons lacking Klf-9 show delayed maturation as reflected by altered expression of early-phase markers, dendritic spine formation, and electrophysiological properties. Adult Klf-9-null mice exhibit normal stem cell proliferation and cell fate specification in the DG but show impaired differentiation of adult-born neurons and decreased neurogenesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. Behavioral analysis of Klf-9-null mice revealed a subtle increase in anxiety-like behavior and an impairment in contextual fear discrimination learning. Thus, Klf-9 is necessary for late-phase maturation of dentate granule neurons both in DG development and during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Klf-9-dependent neuronal maturation may therefore represent a candidate regulatory mechanism underlying these temporally distinct processes.},

abstract = {Several genes have been identified that are activated or repressed by thyroid hormone in tadpole tissues during metamorphosis of the frog Xenopus laevis. One rapidly and strongly induced gene encodes the Xenopus homolog of basic transcription element-binding protein 1 (xBTEB1), an SP1-related transcription factor. xBTEB1 has similar DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activation properties as mammalian BTEB1. The thyroid hormone-dependent regulation of xBTEB1 was investigated using a modified electrophoretic mobility shift assay to scan genomic DNA for receptor-binding sites. Due to the tetraploid X. laevis genome, xBTEB1 is duplicated, and thyroid hormone regulates both copies. A consensus thyroid hormone response element (TRE) lies far upstream of the transcriptional start site of both genes. The TRE is nested within a 200-bp region of high sequence conservation between these two genes that duplicated millions of years ago. The TRE acts as a strong response element in transfection assays using a heterologous promoter or its native context. Thus, one of the earliest thyroid hormone-induced genes in tadpoles is a transcription factor regulated through an evolutionarily conserved TRE. xBTEB1 is predicted to play an important role in downstream gene regulation leading to the growth and remodeling of tissues at metamorphosis.},

BTEB mRNA levels in cerebral cortex exhibit developmental regulation and thyroid hormone dependence. T(3) regulation of BTEB mRNA is neural cell-specific, being up-regulated in primary cultures of embryonic neurons (E16) and in neonatal astrocytes (P2), but not in neonatal oligodendrocytes (P2). T(3) rapidly up-regulated BTEB mRNA in neuro-2a cells engineered to express thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1 but not in cells expressing TRalpha1, suggesting that the regulation of this gene is specific to the TRbeta1 isoform. Several lines of evidence support a transcriptional action of T(3) on BTEB gene expression. Overexpression of BTEB in Neuro-2a cells dramatically increased the number and length of neurites in a dose-dependent manner suggesting a role for this transcription factor in neuronal process formation. However, other T(3)-dependent changes were not altered; i.e. overexpression of BTEB had no effect on the rate of cell proliferation nor on the expression of acetylcholinesterase activity.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential regulators of vertebrate development and metabolism. Central mechanisms governing their production have evolved, with the beta-TH receptor (TRbeta) playing a key regulatory role in the negative feedback effects of circulating TH levels on production of hypothalamic TRH and hypophyseal TSH. Both TRbeta-isoforms (TRbeta1 and TRbeta2) are expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. However, their respective roles in TH-dependent transcriptional regulation of TRH are undefined. We confirmed the preferential role of TRbeta vs. TRalpha isoforms in TRH regulation in wild-type mice in vivo by using the TRbeta preferential agonist GC-1. We next determined the effects of tissue-specific rescue of TRbeta1 and TRbeta2 isoforms by somatic gene transfer in hypothalami of TRbeta null (TRbeta(-/-)) mice. TH-dependent TRH transcriptional repression was impaired in TRbeta(-/-) mice, but was restored by cotransfection of either TRbeta1 or TRbeta2 into the hypothalamus. TRbeta1, but not TRbeta2, displayed a role in ligand-independent activation. In situ hybridization was used to examine endogenous TRH expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of TRbeta(-/-) or TRalpha null (TRalpha(o/o)) mice under different thyroid states. In contrast to published data on TRbeta2(-/-) mice, we found that both ligand-independent TRH activation and ligand-dependent TRH repression were severely impaired in TRbeta(-/-) mice. This study thus provides functional in vivo data showing that both TRbeta1 and TRbeta2 isoforms have specific roles in regulating TRH transcription.},

abstract = {Receptors for glucocorticoids, estrogens, androgens, and thyroid hormones have been detected in mitochondria of various cell types by Western blotting, immunofluorescence labeling, confocal microscopy, and immunogold electron microscopy. A role of these receptors in mitochondrial transcription, OXPHOS biosynthesis, and apoptosis is now being revealed. Steroid and thyroid hormones regulate energy production, inducing nuclear and mitochondrial OXPHOS genes by way of cognate receptors. In addition to the action of the nuclearly localized receptors on nuclear OXPHOS gene transcription, a parallel direct action of the mitochondrially localized receptors on mitochondrial transcription has been demonstrated. The coordination of transcription activation in nuclei and mitochondria by the respective receptors is in part realized by their binding to common trans acting elements in the two genomes. Recent evidence points to a role of the mitochondrial receptors in cell survival and apoptosis, exerted by genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. The identification of additional receptors of the superfamily of nuclear receptors and of other nuclear transcription factors in mitochondria increases their arsenal of regulatory molecules and further underlines the central role of these organelles in the integration of growth, metabolic, and cell survival signals.},

Groups of 10- to 11-day pregnant rats were injected with saline or hydrocortisone (50 mg/kg) once a day for 10 days. The pancreas, antrum, and small intestine of newborns (8-10 h after birth) were analysed for various determinants of growth and maturation. The small-intestinal weight and DNA, RNA, and protein were significantly higher in newborns from hydrocortisone-treated animals than those of saline-treated controls. Hydrocortisone treatment resulted in an induction of sucrase and significantly stimulated total lactase activity. After the steroid treatment during pregnancy, the weight of the pancreas and its DNA content in newborns were also significantly elevated when compared with those from saline-treated controls. However, neither pancreatic RNA nor protein content differed significantly between the groups. Antral gastrin content in newborns from hydrocortisone-treated mothers was significantly higher than that from saline-treated controls. Pancreatic gastrin content in newborns was slightly but not significantly reduced after the steroid administration to mothers. It is concluded that glucocorticoids induce growth and maturation of foetal gut and pancreas.},

abstract = {Cellular entry is required for conversion of thyroid hormone by the intracellular deiodinases and for binding of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T(3)) to its nuclear receptors. Recently, several transporters capable of thyroid hormone transport have been identified. Functional expression studies using Xenopus laevis oocytes have demonstrated that organic anion transporters (e.g., OATPs), and L-type amino acid transporters (LATs) facilitate thyroid hormone uptake. Among these, OATP1C1 has a high affinity and specificity for thyroxine (T(4)). OATP1C1 is expressed in capillaries throughout the brain, suggesting it is critical for transport of T(4) over the blood-brain barrier. We have also characterized a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family, MCT8, as a very active and specific thyroid hormone transporter. Human MCT8 shows preference for T(3) as the ligand. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain but is also widely distributed in other tissues. The MCT8 gene is located on the X chromosome. Recently, mutations in MCT8 have been found to be associated with severe X-linked psychomotor retardation and strongly elevated serum T(3) levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic causes of nonsyndromic ovarian insufficiency are largely unknown. A nuclear receptor, NR5A1 (also called steroidogenic factor 1), is a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-steroidogenic axis. Mutation of NR5A1 causes 46,XY disorders of sex development, with or without adrenal failure, but growing experimental evidence from studies in mice suggests a key role for this factor in ovarian development and function as well. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that mutations in NR5A1 cause disorders of ovarian development and function, we sequenced NR5A1 in four families with histories of both 46,XY disorders of sex development and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency and in 25 subjects with sporadic ovarian insufficiency. None of the affected subjects had clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS: Members of each of the four families and 2 of the 25 subjects with isolated ovarian insufficiency carried mutations in the NR5A1 gene. In-frame deletions and frameshift and missense mutations were detected. Functional studies indicated that these mutations substantially impaired NR5A1 transactivational activity. Mutations were associated with a range of ovarian anomalies, including 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency. We did not observe these mutations in more than 700 control alleles. CONCLUSIONS: NR5A1 mutations are associated with 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency and 46,XY disorders of sex development.},

abstract = {Both thyroid hormone (T3) and growth hormone (GH) are important regulators of somatic growth in birds and mammals. Although T3-mediated gene transcription is well known, the molecular basis of T3 interaction with GH on growth and development of birds remains unknown. In earlier studies, we discovered that exogenous GH alone increased accumulation of visceral fat in young chickens, while the combination of GH injections and dietary T3 worked synergistically to deplete body fat. In the present study, cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses enabled us to examine hepatic gene expression in young chickens after chronic manipulation of thyroid status and GH injection alone or in combination with T3. Thyroid status modulates expression of common and unique sets of genes involved in a wide range of molecular functions (i.e., energy metabolism, storage and transport, signal transduction, protein turnover and drug detoxification). Hepatic expression of 35 genes was altered by hypothyroidism (e.g., ADFP, ANGPTL3, GSTalpha, CAT, PPARG, HMGCL, GHR, IGF1, STAT3, THRSPalpha), whereas hyperthyroidism affected expression of another cluster of 13 genes (e.g., IGFBP1, KHK, LDHB, BAIA2L1, SULT1B, TRIAD3). Several genes were identified which have not been previously ascribed as T3 responsive (e.g., DEFB9, EPS8L2, ARHGAP1, LASS2, INHBC). Exogenous GH altered expression of 17 genes (e.g., CCAR1, CYP2C45, GYS2, ENOB, HK1, FABP1, SQLE, SOCS2, UPG2). The T3+GH treatment depleted the greatest amount of body fat, where 34 differentially expressed genes were unique to this group (e.g., C/EBP, CDC42EP1, SYDE2, PCK2, PIK4CA, TH1L, GPT2, BHMT). The marked reduction in body fat brought about by the T3+GH synergism could involve modulation of hormone signaling via altered activity of the Ras superfamily of molecular switches, which control diverse biological processes. In conclusion, this study provides the first global analysis of endocrine (T3 and GH) regulation of hepatic gene transcription in the chicken.},

abstract = {Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were found to attach and partially spread on human tenascin. The attachment of endothelial cells to tenascin results in elongated cells with interconnecting processes and is distinct from the flattened appearance of endothelial cells on fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin or laminin substrata, suggesting a role for tenascin in modulating cell adhesion and motility. Endothelial attachment to tenascin was partially inhibitable by the SRRGDMS peptide derived from human tenascin and completely inhibitable by anti-integrin antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3. Endothelial cell attachment to tenascin could be inhibited up to 80\% with anti-alpha 2 and anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibodies P1E6 and P4C10, respectively, and this was associated with a complete loss in cell spreading. In contrast, pretreatment of endothelial cells with the anti-alpha v beta 3 monoclonal antibody LM609, resulted in a 35\% inhibition in cell attachment but did not alter cell spreading. In combination the anti-alpha 2 and anti-alpha v beta 3 antibodies, could completely abrogate cell spreading and attachment to tenascin-coated surfaces. Affinity purification of 125I-labeled endothelial cell extract on a tenascin matrix column followed by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies to different integrin alpha and beta subunits resulted in the identification of alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 integrins, respectively, as tenascin binding receptors. Collagen affinity-purified alpha 2 beta 1 receptor from endothelial cells bound not only to collagen and laminin but also to tenascin in a radio receptor binding assay. The results demonstrate that alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 mediate distinct endothelial cell interactions with tenascin; cell spreading and cell binding, respectively. Binding by alpha v beta 3 is mediated by the SRRGDMS site on tenascin, whereas the alpha 2 beta 1 binding site remains undefined. The interaction of alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 with tenascin may be regulated in a cell type-specific manner as evidenced by the binding of endothelial cell alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 to tenascin, and the lack of binding by the same receptors on osteosarcoma MG63 to tenascin.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids cause profound effects on bone cell replication, differentiation, and function. Glucocorticoids increase bone resorption by stimulating osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression of RANK ligand and decreasing the expression of its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin. In accordance with the increase in bone resorption, glucocorticoids stimulate the expression of collagenase 3 by posttranscriptional mechanisms. The most significant effect of glucocorticoids in bone is an inhibition of bone formation. This is because of a decrease in the number of osteoblasts and their function. The decrease in cell number is secondary to a decrease in osteoblastic cell replication and differentiation, and an increase in the apoptosis of mature osteoblasts. Glucocorticoids decrease osteoblastic function directly and indirectly through the modulation of growth factor expression, receptor binding, or binding protein levels. Clinically, patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) develop bone loss in the first few months of glucocorticoid exposure, and modest doses of glucocorticoids increase the risk of fractures of the spine and hip. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and prevent and revert the bone loss that follows glucocorticoid exposure. Anabolic agents, such as parathyroid hormone, stimulate bone formation and can increase bone mass in GIOP.},

abstract = {It is increasingly accepted that alterations of the intrauterine and early postnatal nutritional, metabolic and hormonal environment may predispose individuals to development of diseases in later life. Results from studies of the offspring of diabetic mothers strongly support this hypothesis. It has also been suggested that being light at birth leads to an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome (Syndrome X) in later life (the Barker hypothesis). The pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie this programming are unclear. However, hormones are important environment-dependent organizers of the developing neuroendocrine-immune network, which regulates all the fundamental processes of life. Hormones can act as 'endogenous functional teratogens' when present in non-physiological concentrations, induced by alterations in the intrauterine or neonatal environment during critical periods of perinatal life. Perinatal hyperinsulinism is pathognomic in offspring of diabetic mothers. Early hyperinsulinism also occurs as a result of early postnatal overfeeding. In rats, endogenous hyperinsulinism, as well as peripheral or intrahypothalamic insulin treatment during perinatal development, may lead to 'malprogramming' of the neuroendocrine systems regulating body weight, food intake and metabolism. This results in an increased disposition to become obese and to develop diabetes throughout life. Similar malprogramming may occur due to perinatal hypercortisolism and hyperleptinism. With regard to 'small baby syndrome' and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, we propose that early postnatal overfeeding of underweight newborns may substantially contribute to their long-term risk of obesity and diabetes. In summary, a complex malprogramming of the central regulation of body weight and metabolism may provide a general aetiopathogenetic concept, explaining perinatally acquired disposition to later disease and, thereby, opening a wide field for primary prevention.},

abstract = {A series of studies was started to gain insight into the functioning of the canine hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis during normo- and hypercortisolemic states. In this first study, we have focused on the binding characteristics of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the brain and pituitary of the adrenalectomized dog. In hippocampal cytosol at 0 C, corticosterone had the highest association rate, followed by cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol had the most rapid rate of dissociation from MR at 0 C (t1/2 = 45.5 h), followed by aldosterone (70.4 h) and corticosterone (102 h). The selective glucocorticoid RU 28362 associated rapidly with hippocampal GR, attaining maximum binding within 4 h, and dissociated with a t1/2 of 34.8 h. Saturation binding of [3H]cortisol in adrenalectomized dog hippocampal cytosol produced a curvilinear Scatchard plot. After inclusion of RU 28362, [3H]cortisol bound solely to MR [dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.34 nM, Bmax = 72.8 fmol/mg]. GR capacity was determined with [3H]RU 28362 (Kd = 0.39 nM, Bmax = 120 fmol/mg). Competition binding analyses of various steroids for MR and GR revealed markedly different patterns of steroid binding specificity for these receptors. The rank order for displacement of [3H]aldosterone binding of MR was: corticosterone greater than aldosterone = cortisol greater than dexamethasone greater than ZK 91587 greater than RU 26752 greater than spironolactone much greater than RU 38486, and for displacement of [3H]RU 28362 binding of GR: RU 28362 much greater than corticosterone = cortisol greater than dexamethasone greater than aldosterone greater than ZK 91587 greater than RU 26752 = RU 38486 much greater than spironolactone. MR was located in all brain regions examined, with highest levels in the septo-hippocampal complex, whereas GR was rather evenly distributed. Substantial amounts of MR and GR were present in the anterior part of the pituitary as well as in the neurointermediate lobe. Our findings show that the ligand binding specificity of canine MR and GR is remarkably different from that of rodent MR and GR, but is similar to that of recombinant-derived human receptors. Spironolactone and RU 38486 are selective antagonists for MR and GR, respectively. In contrast to other species, the dog has relatively large quantities of MR widely distributed in the brain and pituitary, which makes this species an interesting animal model to study the role of corticosteroid receptor diversity in control of homeostasis.},

abstract = {Apart from their classic genomic effects, it is well known that glucocorticoids also have rapid, nongenomically mediated effects. Three different mechanisms are currently under discussion as being responsible for these effects: (1) specific interaction with the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (cGCR), (2) nonspecific interactions with cellular membranes and (3) specific interactions with membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors (mGCR). With regard to the first mechanism, there is evidence that although the binding of glucocorticoids to the cGCR-associated multi-protein complex induces the further processes of the classic path, it also leads to a rapid intracellular signalling through other components of the complex (e.g. Src). For the second mechanism, a nonspecific interactive effect with cellular membranes through the intercalation of glucocorticoid molecules is being discussed, which primarily alters cellular functions by influencing cation transport via the plasma membrane and by increasing the proton leak of the mitochondria. With regard to the third, mGCR-mediated mechanism, the first evidence has now been found to suggest a physiological expression of membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors on human cells, whereas in humans this had previously only been demonstrated on lymphoma cells. The clinical importance and therapeutic relevance of these rapid glucocorticoid effects remains unclear at present, although effects on intracellular signalling, interferences with bioenergetically relevant cell functions and the induction of apoptosis via the mGCR are being discussed. This article gives a detailed presentation of the data available at present concerning rapid glucocorticoid effects on immune cells.},

abstract = {In order to characterize Sterling's triiodothyronine (T3) mitochondrial receptor using photoaffinity labeling, we observed two specific T3-binding proteins in the inner membrane (28 kDa) and in the matrix (43 kDa) of rat liver mitochondria. Western blots and immunoprecipitation using antibodies raised against the T3-binding domain of the T3 nuclear receptor c-Erb A alpha 1 indicated that at least the 43-kDa protein was c-Erb A alpha 1-related. In addition, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the occurrence of a c-Erb A alpha 1-related mitochondrial protein that specifically binds to a natural or a palindromic thyroid-responsive element. Moreover, this protein specifically binds to a direct repeat 2 sequence located in the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, electron microscopy studies allowed the direct observation of a c-Erb A-related protein in mitochondria. Lastly, the relative amounts of the 43-kDa protein related to c-Erb A alpha 1 were in good correlation with the known mitochondrial mass in three typical tissues. Interestingly, expression of a truncated form of the c-Erb A alpha 1 nuclear receptor in CV1 cells was associated with a mitochondrial localization and a stimulation of mitochondrial activity. These results supply evidence of the localization of a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily in the mitochondrial matrix involved in the regulation of mitochondrial activity that could act as a mitochondrial T3-dependent transcription factor.},

abstract = {Competition is known to decrease growth and development rate in tadpoles, but the physiological basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood. We hypothesized that competition results in increased production of stress hormones and that these hormones are responsible for the suppression of growth and development. To test this hypothesis, we measured whole-body corticosterone content in premetamorphic Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) tadpoles raised at two different population densities and three different food levels. Whole body corticosterone content was elevated in tadpoles subjected to either limited food (at low density) or high density. Within the low and intermediate food treatments, high density reduced tadpole growth and slowed development. Limited food slowed growth and development at all densities. Blocking corticoid synthesis by treating tadpoles with metyrapone (MTP) reversed the growth suppression caused by high density (tested in the intermediate food level treatment) but did not alter the effect of density on development rate. MTP treatment did not alter the depressive effect of limited resources on growth or development. Our results suggest that elevated corticoid biosynthesis mediates the negative effect of increased population density (i.e., increased intraspecific competition) on tadpole growth.},

abstract = {Nuclear receptor coregulators are coactivators or corepressors that are required by nuclear receptors for efficient transcripitonal regulation. In this context, we define coactivators, broadly, as molecules that interact with nuclear receptors and enhance their transactivation. Analogously, we refer to nuclear receptor corepressors as factors that interact with nuclear receptors and lower the transcription rate at their target genes. Most coregulators are, by definition, rate limiting for nuclear receptor activation and repression, but do not significantly alter basal transcription. Recent data have indicated multiple modes of action of coregulators, including direct interactions with basal transcription factors and covalent modification of histones and other proteins. Reflecting this functional diversity, many coregulators exist in distinct steady state precomplexes, which are thought to associate in promoter-specific configurations. In addition, these factors may function as molecular gates to enable integration of diverse signal transduction pathways at nuclear receptor-regulated promoters. This review will summarize selected aspects of our current knowledge of the cellular and molecular biology of nuclear receptor coregulators.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones have well-documented effects on the skeleton although the mechanism of their action on bone is poorly understood. We have recently reported the presence of different thyroid hormone receptor isoforms in human bone. However, there is evidence to suggest that the expression of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) protein may not necessarily correlate with its mRNA. In this study, we used specific digoxigenin-labeled ribo probes to investigate the expression of TRalpha1, variant TRalpha2, TRbeta1, and in particular TRbeta2 mRNA in human osteophytic bone and osteoclastoma tissue in situ. The number of positive cells was expressed as the percentage of the total number of cells of the same phenotype. In osteophytes, at sites of endochondral ossification, TRalpha1, variant TRalpha2, TRbeta1, and TRbeta2 mRNA were widely distributed in undifferentiated, proliferating, mature and hypertrophic chondrocytes. At sites of bone remodeling, TRalpha1 mRNA was expressed in the majority (> 90\%) of osteoblasts. TRbeta1 and the variant TR-alpha2 mRNA were moderately expressed in approximately 75\% of cells with only a few osteoblasts (< 25\%) expressing TRbeta2 mRNA. All the TR transcripts were highly expressed in multinucleated osteoclasts in osteoclastoma tissue. The distribution of TR mRNAs was similar to TR receptor protein expression (as we have previously reported) in both osteophytic bone and osteoclastoma tissue except TRalpha1 mRNA that was highly expressed in osteoclasts and in undifferentiated, proliferating, mature, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in contrast to its receptor protein expression. This study highlights the importance of studying both TR mRNA and receptor proteins in triiodothyronine (T3) responsive tissues. This is also the first demonstration of the presence of TRbeta2 mRNA in bone. The role of TRbeta2 in mediating the actions of thyroid hormones in bone is not known and requires further investigation.},

abstract = {Human pregnancy is associated with sexually dimorphic differences in mortality and morbidity of the fetus with the male fetus experiencing the poorest outcome following complications such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term delivery and infection. The physiological mechanisms that confer these differences have not been well characterised in the human. Work conducted on the effect of maternal asthma during pregnancy, combining data collected from the mother, placenta and fetus has found some significant sex-related mechanistic differences associated with fetal growth in both normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by asthma. Specifically, sexually dimorphic differences have been found in placental glucocorticoid metabolism in male and female fetuses of normal pregnancies. In response to the presence of maternal asthma, only the female fetus alters placental glucocorticoid metabolism resulting in decreased growth. The male fetus does not alter placental function or growth in response to maternal asthma. As a result of the alterations in glucocorticoid metabolism in the female, downstream changes occur in pathways regulated by glucocorticoids. These data suggest that the female fetus adjusts placental function and reduces growth to compensate for maternal disease. However, the male fetus continues to grow in response to maternal asthma with no changes in placental function. This response by the male fetus may partially contribute to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality in this sex.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids are vital for the structural and functional maturation of foetal organs, yet excessive foetal exposure is detrimental to adult cardiovascular health. To elucidate the role of glucocorticoid signalling in late-gestation cardiovascular maturation, we have generated mice with conditional disruption of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells using smooth muscle protein 22-driven Cre recombinase (SMGRKO mice) and compared them with mice with global deficiency in GR (GR(-/-)). Echocardiography shows impaired heart function in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at embryonic day (E)17.5, associated with generalized oedema. Cardiac ultrastructure is markedly disrupted in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at E17.5, with short, disorganized myofibrils and cardiomyocytes that fail to align in the compact myocardium. Failure to induce critical genes involved in contractile function, calcium handling and energy metabolism underpins this common phenotype. However, although hearts of GR(-/-) mice are smaller, with 22\% reduced ventricular volume at E17.5, SMGRKO hearts are normally sized. Moreover, while levels of mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic peptide are reduced in E17.5 GR(-/-) hearts, they are normal in foetal SMGRKO hearts. These data demonstrate that structural, functional and biochemical maturation of the foetal heart is dependent on glucocorticoid signalling within cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle, though some aspects of heart maturation (size, ANP expression) are independent of GR at these key sites.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone is a critical regulator of growth, development, and metabolism in virtually all tissues, and altered thyroid status affects many organs and systems. Although for many years testis has been regarded as a thyroid hormone unresponsive organ, it is now evident that thyroid hormone plays an important role in testicular development and function. A considerable amount of data show that thyroid hormone influences steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. The involvement of tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) in the control of Sertoli cell proliferation and functional maturation is widely accepted, as well as its role in postnatal Leydig cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. The presence of thyroid hormone receptors in testicular cells throughout development and in adulthood implies that T(3) may act directly on these cells to bring about its effects. Several recent studies have employed different methodologies and techniques in an attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone effects on testicular cells. The current review aims at presenting an updated picture of the recent advances made regarding the role of thyroid hormones in male gonadal function.},

Because glucocorticoids influence airway maturation, we studied the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on tropoelastin expression during fetal lung development. Timed-pregnant rats were treated with Dex (1 mg/kg daily), and fetal lungs were collected 3 days later at 17, 19, and 21 days of gestation. Dex treatment resulted in about a threefold increase in tropoelastin mRNA levels at 19 days concomitant with accelerated airway development. By in situ hybridization, Dex treatment increased the number of tropoelastin-expressing cells and the level of tropoelastin mRNA per cell. In organ culture, Dex increased lung tropoelastin expression and augmented cortisol stimulation of tropoelastin expression. In fetal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, 10(-8) M Dex upregulated tropoelastin mRNA expression and increased tropoelastin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in transient transfections. These data indicate that pharmacologically administered glucocorticoids transcriptionally upregulate fetal lung tropoelastin expression and suggest that steroid hormones may be important regulators of elastin production in vivo.},

abstract = {We have defined and characterized a region upstream of the bovine prolactin gene that confers repression by glucocorticoids. This 'negative glucocorticoid response element' (nGRE) contains multiple footprinting sites for purified glucocorticoid receptor protein between -51 and -562 bp. A strong consensus sequence for receptor binding within the nGRE has not yet been defined, but it is apparent that nGRE sequences differ from the GRE consensus elements that confer positive glucocorticoid regulation. Unlike 'positive' GREs, the nGRE enhances promoter activity in the absence of glucocorticoids or receptor, presumably through the action of a protein that binds in the same region and activates transcription. The hormone-receptor complex appears to negate this enhancement by competing or inactivating the second factor. As with positive GREs, nGRE sequences confer hormonal regulation upon linked heterologous promoters within various cell types; a 34-bp subfragment containing a single receptor binding site is sufficient for nGRE activity. We speculate that nGRE sequences might alter the structure of bound receptor, thereby preventing it from functioning as a positive regulator when bound at those sites.},

We investigated the effects of dietary restriction, which elevates endogenous corticosterone (CORT), or exposure to exogenous CORT added to the aquarium water of Xenopus laevis tadpoles on later-life measures of growth, feeding behavior, and neuroendocrine stress axis activity. Dietary restriction of prometamorphic tadpoles reduced body size at metamorphosis, but juvenile frogs increased food intake, showed catch-up growth through 21 d after metamorphosis, and had elevated whole-body CORT content compared with controls. Dietary restriction causes increased CORT in tadpoles, so to mimic this increase, we treated tadpoles with 100 nm CORT or vehicle for 5 or 10 d and then reared juvenile frogs to 2 months after metamorphosis. Treatment with CORT decreased body weight at metamorphosis, but juvenile frogs showed catch-up growth and had elevated basal plasma (CORT). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CORT exposure as a tadpole led to decreased glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity in brain regions involved with stress axis regulation and in the anterior pituitary gland of juvenile frogs. The elevated CORT in juvenile frogs, which could result from decreased negative feedback owing to down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor, may drive the hyperphagic response. Taken together, our findings suggest that long-term, stable phenotypic changes in response to elevated glucocorticoids early in life are an ancient and conserved feature of the vertebrate lineage.},

abstract = {The stress system coordinates the adaptive responses of the organism to stressors of any kind.(1). The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC/NE)-autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the limbs of the autonomic system. Activation of the stress system leads to behavioral and peripheral changes that improve the ability of the organism to adjust homeostasis and increase its chances for survival. The CRH and LC/NE systems stimulate arousal and attention, as well as the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which is involved in anticipatory and reward phenomena, and the hypothalamic beta-endorphin system, which suppresses pain sensation and, hence, increases analgesia. CRH inhibits appetite and activates thermogenesis via the catecholaminergic system. Also, reciprocal interactions exist between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the stress system, which stimulates these elements and is regulated by them. CRH plays an important role in inhibiting GnRH secretion during stress, while, via somatostatin, it also inhibits GH, TRH and TSH secretion, suppressing, thus, the reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. Interestingly, all three of these functions receive and depend on positive catecholaminergic input. The end-hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, glucocorticoids, on the other hand, have multiple roles. They simultaneously inhibit the CRH, LC/NE and beta-endorphin systems and stimulate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the CRH peptidergic central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, they directly inhibit pituitary gonadotropin, GH and TSH secretion, render the target tissues of sex steroids and growth factors resistant to these substances and suppress the 5' deiodinase, which converts the relatively inactive tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) to triiodothyronine (T(3)), contributing further to the suppression of reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. They also have direct as well as insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension (metabolic syndrome X) and direct effects on the bone, causing "low turnover" osteoporosis. Central CRH, via glucocorticoids and catecholamines, inhibits the inflammatory reaction, while directly secreted by peripheral nerves CRH stimulates local inflammation (immune CRH). CRH antagonists may be useful in human pathologic states, such as melancholic depression and chronic anxiety, associated with chronic hyperactivity of the stress system, along with predictable behavioral, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune changes, based on the interrelations outlined above. Conversely, potentiators of CRH secretion/action may be useful to treat atypical depression, postpartum depression and the fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndromes, all characterized by low HPA axis and LC/NE activity, fatigue, depressive symptomatology, hyperalgesia and increased immune/inflammatory responses to stimuli.},

abstract = {Proper development of the mammalian CNS requires sufficient thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone deficiency during a brief perinatal period produces severe neurological defects in humans and experimental animals. Thyroid hormone exerts its effects through nuclear receptors, which modulate the transcription of downstream genes in response to hormone binding. Surprisingly, few genes that are regulated by thyroid hormone receptors in the CNS have been described. Here, I report the isolation and characterization of genes that are expressed in response to thyroid hormone in developing rat brain. One such gene (Srg1) encodes a novel protein related to synaptotagmin, a protein involved in regulating neurotransmitter release; another (hr) encodes a putative zinc finger protein related to the product of a recently identified mouse gene, hairless. Both Srg1 and hr are induced rapidly (<4 hr), suggesting that they are regulated directly by thyroid hormone. The temporal and spatial expression of both Srg1 and hr is characteristic of genes important to nervous system development. Srg1 and hr are likely part of a cascade of gene activation induced by thyroid hormone that is critical for CNS organization and development.},

abstract = {Studies of individual domains or subdomains of the proteins making up the nuclear receptor family have stressed their modular nature. Nevertheless, these receptors function as complete proteins. Studies of specific mutations suggest that in the holoreceptors, intramolecular domain-domain interactions are important for complete function, but there is little knowledge concerning these interactions. The important transcriptional transactivation function in the N-terminal part of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) appears to have little inherent structure. To study its interactions with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the GR, we have expressed the complete sequence from the N-terminal through the DBD of the human GR. Circular dichroism analyses of this highly purified, multidomain protein show that it has a considerable helical content. We hypothesized that binding of its DBD to the cognate glucocorticoid response element would confer additional structure upon the N-terminal domain. Circular dichroism and fluorescence emission studies suggest that additional helicity as well as tertiary structure occur in the two-domain protein upon DNA binding. In sum, our data suggest that interdomain interactions consequent to DNA binding imparts structure to the portion of the GR that contains a major transactivation domain.},

abstract = {Stress has complex effects on hippocampal structure and function, which consequently affects learning and memory. These effects are mediated in part by circulating glucocorticoids (GC) acting via the intracellular GC receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Here, we investigated GC regulation of Kr\"{u}ppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), a transcription factor implicated in neuronal development and plasticity. Injection of corticosterone (CORT) in postnatal d 6 and 30 mice increased Klf9 mRNA and heteronuclear RNA by 1 h in the hippocampal region. Treatment of the mouse hippocampal cell line HT-22 with CORT caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in Klf9 mRNA. The CORT induction of Klf9 was resistant to protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that Klf9 is a direct CORT-response gene. In support of this hypothesis, we identified two GR/MR response elements (GRE/MRE) located -6.1 and -5.3 kb relative to the transcription start site, and we verified their functionality by enhancer-reporter, gel shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The -5.3-kb GRE/MRE is largely conserved across tetrapods, but conserved orthologs of the -6.1-kb GRE/MRE were only detected in therian mammals. GC treatment caused recruitment of the GR, histone hyperacetylation, and nucleosome removal at Klf9 upstream regions. Our findings support a predominant role for GR, with a minor contribution of MR, in the direct regulation of Klf9 acting via two GRE/MRE located in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. KLF9 may play a key role in GC actions on hippocampal development and plasticity.},

There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR.

Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Variations in parental care direct phenotypic development across many species. Variations in maternal pup licking/grooming (LG) in the rat regulate the development of individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. The adult offspring of mothers that show an increased frequency of pup LG have increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and more modest pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. This parental effect is mediated by the epigenetic programming of a GR exon 1 promoter (exon 1(7)) through the binding of the transcription factor nerve growth factor-inducible factor A (NGFI-A). In this paper, we report that: (i) the association of NGFI-A with the exon 1(7) GR promoter is dynamically regulated by mother-pup interactions; (ii) this effect is mimicked by artificial tactile stimulation comparable to that provided by pup LG; (iii) that serotonin (5-HT) induces an NGFI-A-dependent increase in GR transcription in hippocampal neurons and NGFI-A overexpression is sufficient for this effect; and (iv) that thyroid hormones and 5-HT are key mediators of the effects of pup LG and tactile stimulation on NGFI-A binding to the exon 1(7) GR promoter in hippocampus. These findings suggest that pup LG directly activates 5-HT systems to initiate intracellular signalling pathways in the hippocampus that regulate GR transcription.},

abstract = {The total dependence of amphibian metamorphosis on thyroid hormone (T(3)) provides a unique vertebrate model for studying the molecular mechanism of T(3) receptor (TR) function in vivo. In vitro transcription and developmental expression studies have led to a dual function model for TR in amphibian development, i.e., TRs act as transcriptional repressors in premetamorphic tadpoles and as activators during metamorphosis. We examined molecular mechanisms of TR action in T3-induced metamorphosis by using dominant-negative receptors (dnTR) ubiquitously expressed in transgenic Xenopus laevis. We showed that T(3)-induced activation of T(3) target genes and morphological changes are blocked in dnTR transgenic animals. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that dnTR bound to target promoters, which led to retention of corepressors and continued histone deacetylation in the presence of T(3). These results thus provide direct in vivo evidence for the first time for a molecular mechanism of altering gene expression by a dnTR. The correlation between dnTR-mediated gene repression and inhibition of metamorphosis also supports a key aspect of the dual function model for TR in development: during T(3)-induced metamorphosis, TR functions as an activator via release of corepressors and promotion of histone acetylation and gene activation.},

Despite structural similarity to other steroid receptors, the GR LBD adopts a surprising dimer configuration involving formation of an intermolecular beta sheet. Functional studies demonstrate that the novel dimer interface is important for GR-mediated activation. The structure also reveals an additional charge clamp that determines the binding selectivity of a coactivator and a distinct ligand binding pocket that explains its selectivity for endogenous steroid hormones.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) gene. To understand the transcriptional program underlying TRbeta mutant-induced phenotypic expression of RTH, cDNA microarrays were used to profile the expression of 11,500 genes in a mouse model of human RTH. RESULTS: We analyzed transcript levels in cerebellum, heart and white adipose tissue from a knock-in mouse (TRbetaPV/PV mouse) that harbors a human mutation (referred to as PV) and faithfully reproduces human RTH. Because TRbetaPV/PV mice have elevated thyroid hormone (T3), to define T3-responsive genes in the context of normal TRbeta, we also analyzed T3 effects in hyperthyroid wild-type gender-matched littermates. Microarray analysis revealed 163 genes responsive to T3 treatment and 187 genes differentially expressed between TRbetaPV/PV mice and wild-type littermates. Both the magnitude and gene make-up of the transcriptional response varied widely across tissues and conditions. We identified genes modulated in T3-dependent PV-independent, T3- and PV-dependent, and T3-independent PV-dependent pathways that illuminated the biological consequences of PV action in vivo. Most T3-responsive genes that were dysregulated in the heart and white adipose tissue of TRbetaPV/PV mice were repressed in T3-treated wild-type mice and upregulated in TRbetaPV/PV mice, suggesting the inappropriate activation of T3-suppressed genes in RTH. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive multi-tissue gene-expression analysis uncovered complex multiple signaling pathways that mediate the molecular actions of TRbeta mutants in vivo. In particular, the T3-independent mutant-dependent genomic response unveiled the contribution of a novel 'change-of-function' of TRbeta mutants to the pathogenesis of RTH. Thus, the molecular actions of TRbeta mutants are more complex than previously envisioned.},

abstract = {An adverse foetal environment is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine and psychological disorders in adulthood. Exposure to stress and its glucocorticoid hormone mediators may underpin this association. In humans and in animal models, prenatal stress, excess exogenous glucocorticoids or inhibition of 11$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2; the placental barrier to maternal glucocorticoids) reduces birth weight and causes hyperglycemia, hypertension, increased HPA axis reactivity, and increased anxiety-related behaviour. Molecular mechanisms that underlie the 'developmental programming' effects of excess glucocorticoids/prenatal stress include epigenetic changes in target gene promoters. In the case of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), this alters tissue-specific GR expression levels, which has persistent and profound effects on glucocorticoid signalling in certain tissues (e.g. brain, liver, and adipose). Crucially, changes in gene expression persist long after the initial challenge, predisposing the individual to disease in later life. Intriguingly, the effects of a challenged pregnancy appear to be transmitted possibly to one or two subsequent generations, suggesting that these epigenetic effects persist.},

abstract = {To determine whether glucocorticoids are involved in pancreas development, glucocorticoid treatment of rat pancreatic buds in vitro was combined with the analysis of transgenic mice lacking the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in specific pancreatic cells. In vitro treatment of embryonic pancreata with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid agonist, induced a decrease of insulin-expressing cell numbers and a doubling of acinar cell area, indicating that glucocorticoids favored acinar differentiation; in line with this, expression of Pdx-1, Pax-6, and Nkx6.1 was downregulated, whereas the mRNA levels of Ptf1-p48 and Hes-1 were increased. The selective inactivation of the GR gene in insulin-expressing beta-cells in mice (using a RIP-Cre transgene) had no measurable consequences on beta- or alpha-cell mass, whereas the absence of GR in the expression domain of Pdx-1 (Pdx-Cre transgene) led to a twofold increased beta-cell mass, with increased islet numbers and size but normal alpha-cell mass in adults. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids play an important role in pancreatic beta-cell lineage, acting before hormone gene expression onset and possibly also modulating the balance between endocrine and exocrine cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Histone deacetylase and chromatin assembly contribute to the control of transcription of the Xenopus TRbetaA gene promoter by the heterodimer of Xenopus thyroid hormone receptor and 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (TR-RXR). Addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) relieves repression of transcription due to chromatin assembly following microinjection of templates into Xenopus oocyte nuclei, and eliminates regulation of transcription by TR-RXR. Expression of Xenopus RPD3p, the catalytic subunit of histone deacetylase, represses the TRbetaA promoter, but only after efficient assembly of the template into nucleosomes. In contrast, the unliganded TR-RXR represses templates only partially assembled into nucleosomes; addition of TSA also relieves this transcriptional repression. This result indicates the distinct requirements for chromatin assembly in mediating transcriptional repression by the deacetylase alone, compared with those needed in the presence of unliganded TR-RXR. In addition, whereas hormone-bound TR-RXR targets chromatin disruption as assayed through changes in minichromosome topology and loss of a regular nucleosomal ladder on micrococcal nuclease digestion, addition of TSA relieves transcriptional repression but does not disrupt chromatin. Thus, TR-RXR can facilitate transcriptional repression in the absence of hormone through mechanisms in addition to recruitment of deacetylase, and disrupts chromatin structure through mechanisms in addition to the inhibition or release of deacetylase.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones and retinoic acid function through nuclear receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid-hormone receptor superfamily. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) require auxiliary nuclear proteins for efficient DNA binding. Here we report that retinoid X receptors RXR alpha is one of these nuclear proteins. RXR alpha interacts both with TRs and with RARs, forming heterodimers in solution that strongly interact with a variety of T3/retinoic acid response elements. Transfection experiments show that RXR alpha can greatly enhance the transcriptional activity of TR and RAR at low retinoic acid concentrations that do not significantly activate RXR alpha itself. Thus, RXR alpha enhances the transcriptional activity of other receptors and its own ligand sensitivity by heterodimer formation. Our studies reveal a new subclass of receptors and a regulatory pathway controlling nuclear receptor activities by heterodimer formation.},

abstract = {Studies of steroid receptors have led to the identification of a superfamily of ligand-inducible regulatory proteins that includes receptors for thyroid hormones and retinoic acid. This family of receptors regulates gene expression through binding to short cis-acting sequences referred to as hormone-response elements. Identification of a functional retinoic acid responsive element is crucial to our understanding of the mechanisms by which retinoic acid receptors activate gene expression and regulate cell differentiation. One impediment to such a study is the absence of any identified gene whose transcription is directly dependent on the receptor-hormone complex. Because the DNA-binding domains of the retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors are highly related (62\% identical in their amino acid sequences), we have investigated the possibility that the retinoic acid receptor could activate gene expression through a thyroid hormone response element. We now report that a human retinoic acid receptor expressed from cloned complementary DNA or the endogenous retinoic acid receptor present in F9 teratocarcinoma cells can activate gene expression from promoters fused to a natural or synthetic thyroid hormone response element. The product translated in vitro from the human retinoic acid receptor cDNA can bind to a thyroid hormone response element with high affinity. The unexpected implication of these findings is that retinoic acid and thyroid hormones, acting through their respective receptors, could control overlapping gene networks involved in the regulation of vertebrate morphogenesis and homeostasis.},

abstract = {Cardiac hypertrophy is a significant independent risk factor for increased mortality, comprising of maladaptive changes in cellular, molecular and metabolic processes that ultimately lead to heart failure. However, cardiac hypertrophy represents a continuum from physiological to compensatory to pathological hypertrophy, so that treatment modalities aimed to shift hypertrophy towards the physiological phenotype would represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. Many of the physiological changes caused by thyroid hormone (TH) treatment may provide direct benefit to the failing heart. Recent experimental studies have shown that TH rapidly activates pro-survival PKB/Akt-mTOR signaling pathways, thus providing cytoprotection and increasing synthesis of normal contractile proteins and metabolic enzymes. TH induces a normal physiological phenotype by binding to nuclear TH receptors that regulate expression of specific genes which promote cell survival and enhance contractile function. Physiological cardiac growth occurs with a coordinated angiogenic response that normalizes myocardial perfusion during hypertrophy, and recent studies support a significant role for TH and its endothelial cell surface integrin receptors and nuclear receptors in neovascularization during TH-induced hypertrophy. The present review examines these molecular mechanisms and intracellular signaling pathways activated in thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy that support its therapeutic potential in the treatment of heart disease.},

@article{Grimaldi2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone (TH) receptor (TR) plays critical roles in vertebrate development. However, the in vivo mechanism of TR action remains poorly explored. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Frog metamorphosis is controlled by TH and mimics the postembryonic period in mammals when high levels of TH are also required. We review here some of the findings on the developmental functions of TH and TR and the associated mechanisms obtained from this model system. MAJOR CONCLUSION: A dual function model for TR in Anuran development was proposed over a decade ago. That is, unliganded TR recruits corepressors to TH response genes in premetamorphic tadpoles to repress these genes and prevent premature metamorphic changes. Subsequently, when TH becomes available, liganded TR recruits coactivators to activate these same genes, leading to metamorphic changes. Over the years, molecular and genetic approaches have provided strong support for this model. Specifically, it has been shown that unliganded TR recruits histone deacetylase containing corepressor complexes during larval stages to control metamorphic timing, while liganded TR recruits multiple histone modifying and chromatin remodeling coactivator complexes during metamorphosis. These complexes can alter chromatin structure via nucleosome position alterations or eviction and histone modifications to contribute to the recruitment of transcriptional machinery and gene activation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The molecular mechanisms of TR action in vivo as revealed from studies on amphibian metamorphosis are very likely applicable to mammalian development as well. These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the diverse effects of TH in normal physiology and diseases caused by TH dysfunction.

abstract = {Although the major hormones controlling amphibian metamorphosis are those of the thyroid, other hormones, notably prolactin and the adrenal steroids, modulate the effects of thyroid hormones (TH). Some authors report that the gonadal steroids stimulate the metamorphic actions of TH whereas others report inhibition. The aims of the present study were to determine the effects of gonadal steroids on TH-induced metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis and to determine the site of action of these steroids. In all cases, hormones were added to the water in which the tadpoles were swimming. The gonadal steroids, testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol, inhibited triiodothyronine (T3)-induced metamorphosis in living, premetamorphic tadpoles of X. laevis. Both steroids, at 3.4 microM, prevented the reduction in body weight and the shrinkage of head and alimentary canal brought about by 1 nM T3. In contrast, 3.4 microM corticosterone stimulated T3-induced metamorphosis. Addition of 100 nM T3 to the medium induced a large reduction in size of X. laevis tails cultured in vitro. The antagonistic effects of testosterone were not reproduced in such cultures, whereas the synergistic action of corticosterone was maintained. Testosterone had no effect upon the specific binding of T3 to X. laevis tail tissue, whereas corticosterone increased such binding. These findings indicate that, while corticosterone stimulates the metamorphic actions of T3 by acting directly in the peripheral tissues, the gonadal steroids, particularly testosterone, inhibit T3 by acting at a more central site. Prolactin is known to antagonize the metamorphic actions of T3 and one such central action could be the stimulation of prolactin synthesis. However, testosterone inhibited the prometamorphic actions of bromocriptine, which stimulates metamorphosis by inhibiting production of prolactin. Thus the central action of testosterone is unlikely to be a stimulation of prolactin production.},

abstract = {Analysis of the relative inducibility of an extensive series of mutant glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) defines features critical to the constitution of an active GRE. Assuming that function as a GRE reflects binding of glucocorticoid receptor, our activity data are consistent with the recognition of the GRE as two hexamer half-sites, each half-site recognized by a single subunit of a receptor dimer, probably in a cooperative fashion. Integrity of both half-sites is necessary for an active element, and spacing of the half-sites is critical. The identity of 1 basepair within the hexamer half-site is unconstrained; the receptor probably makes no base-specific contacts at this position. In contrast, at other positions within the half-site, limited substitutions (if any) can be tolerated. These results along with data from certain insertion mutations suggest that the receptor recognizes each hexamer half-site as two separable subelements. A further implication is that the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor is composed of distinct subdomains, which interact with the subelements of the recognition sequence.},

abstract = {To investigate the determinants of promoter-specific gene regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we compared the composition and function of regulatory complexes at two NFkappaB-responsive genes that are differentially regulated by GR. Transcription of the IL-8 and IkappaBalpha genes is stimulated by TNFalpha in A549 cells, but GR selectively represses IL-8 mRNA synthesis by inhibiting Ser2 phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD). The proximal kappaB elements at these genes differ in sequence by a single base pair, and both recruited RelA and p50. Surprisingly, GR was recruited to both of these elements, despite the fact that GR failed to repress the IkappaBalpha promoter. Rather, the regulatory complexes formed at IL-8 and IkappaBalpha were distinguished by differential recruitment of the Ser2 CTD kinase, P-TEFb. Disruption of P-TEFb function by the Cdk-inhibitor, DRB, or by small interfering RNA selectively blocked TNFalpha stimulation of IL-8 mRNA production. GR competed with P-TEFb recruitment to the IL-8 promoter. Strikingly, IL-8 mRNA synthesis was repressed by GR at a post-initiation step, demonstrating that promoter proximal regulatory sequences assemble complexes that impact early and late stages of mRNA synthesis. Thus, GR accomplishes selective repression by targeting promoter-specific components of NFkappaB regulatory complexes.},

abstract = {Antisteroid hormones compete for hormone binding at the receptor level and prevent the hormonal response. A new concept is proposed for explaining the antiglucocorticosteroid activity of RU 486 in the chick oviduct system. It is based on the ability of the antisteroid to stabilize the hetero-oligomeric 8S-form of the glucocorticosteroid receptor (GR), which involves the interaction of the 94k-receptor and heat-shock protein MW 90,000 (hsp 90). It is proposed that hsp 90 caps the DNA binding site of the receptor, and this prevents it from binding to the DNA of hormone regulatory elements (HRE) and increasing transcription of regulated genes. This paper reviews other antiglucocorticosteroid and antiestrogen systems with reference to this hypothesis and also describes a four-step analysis of the molecular mechanism of antisteroid hormone action at the receptor level.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids stimulate transcriptional initiation within integrated mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA sequences in infected cells. We report here that production of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) RNA is stimulated as much as 50-fold by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, when sequences from a particular region of MTV DNA are fused upstream of the normally constitutive tk promoter region. Three cloned fragments of MTV DNA were tested, each itself lacking the sequences required for transcription initiation. We monitored the effects of dexamethasone on the efficiency with which these recombinants transfect a tk- rat cell line to a tk+ phenotype, and measured tk enzymatic activity, the size and abundance of tk mRNA, and the 5' termini of tk transcripts in the transfectants. We conclude that the MTV promoter region contains a "glucocorticoid response element" that can be separated from a second element essential for MTV transcription initiation. The hormone response element maps within a 340-base pair MTV DNA fragment that contains specific binding sites for purified glucocorticoid receptor protein in vitro, implying that receptor binding at these sites in vivo may mediate hormone responsiveness. Comparison of several different constructions indicates that the location and orientation of the glucocorticoid response element relative to the transcription start site is not rigidly constrained.},

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages may either promote or down-regulate inflammatory reactions depending on their state of activation. The effects of glucocorticoids (GCs), the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs, on monocytes are currently not well defined. By analyzing the GC-induced expression pattern in human monocytes by microarray technology, we identified for the first time GC-dependent regulation of 133 genes, including anti-inflammatory molecules such as adenosine A3 receptor, CD1d, and IL-1 receptor II. The results were independently confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Functional clustering of GC-regulated genes indicated induction of monocytic properties such as phagocytosis and motility as well as repression of adhesion, apoptosis, and oxidative burst. These predictions were confirmed by independent functional assays. GCs up-regulate fMLP receptors and specifically promote chemotaxis to this chemoattractant. Furthermore, GCs promote survival of an anti-inflammatory monocytic phenotype in inflammatory reactions, probably by inhibition of apoptosis because of oxidative stress. GCs limit tissue damage because of induction of antioxidative properties and high capacity for phagocytosis of proinflammatory agents. Thus, GC treatment did not cause a global suppression of monocytic effector functions but results in differentiation of a specific anti-inflammatory phenotype which seems to be actively involved in resolution of inflammatory reactions.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene generates a nonhormone binding splice variant (hGRbeta) that differs from the wild-type receptor (hGRalpha) only at the carboxyl terminus. Previously we have shown that hGRbeta inhibits the transcriptional activity of hGRalpha, which is consistent with reports of elevated hGRbeta expression in patients with generalized and tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance. The potential role of hGRbeta in the regulation of target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids prompted us to further evaluate its dominant negative activity in other model systems and to investigate its mode of action. We demonstrate in multiple cell types that hGRbeta inhibits hGRalpha-mediated activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. In contrast, the ability of the progesterone and androgen receptors to activate this promoter is only weakly affected by hGRbeta. hGRbeta also inhibits hGRalpha-mediated repression of an NF-kappaB-responsive promoter but does not interfere with homologous down-regulation of hGRalpha. We show that hGRbeta can associate with the heat shock protein hsp90 although with lower affinity than hGRalpha. In addition, hGRbeta binds GRE-containing DNA with a greater capacity than hGRalpha in the absence of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid treatment enhances hGRalpha, but not hGRbeta, binding to DNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that hGRalpha and hGRbeta can physically associate with each other in a heterodimer. Finally, we show that the dominant negative activity of hGRbeta resides within its unique carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids. Taken together, our results suggest that formation of transcriptionally impaired hGRalpha-hGRbeta heterodimers is an important component of the mechanism responsible for the dominant negative activity of hGRbeta.},

abstract = {The enzymes and pathways of steroidogenesis are familiar to most endocrinologists, but the biochemistry and molecular biology of these processes are still being studied. This chapter outlines current knowledge about each enzyme. The quantitative regulation of steroidogenesis occurs at the first step, the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Chronic regulation is principally at the level of transcription of the gene for P450 side chain cleave (P450scc), which is the enzymatically rate-limiting step. Acute regulation is mediated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which facilitates the rapid influx of cholesterol into mitochondria, where P450scc resides. Qualitative regulation, determining the class of steroid produced, is principally determined by P450c17. In the absence of P450c17 in the zona glomerulosa, C21 deoxy steroids are produced, leading to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. In the presence of the 17alpha-hydroxylase but not the 17,20 lyase activity of P450c17 in the zona fasciculata, C21, 17-hydroxy steroids are produced, leading to the glucocorticoid cortisol. When both the 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities of P450c17 are present in the zona reticularis, the androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone is produced. The discrimination between 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities is regulated by two posttranslational events, the serine phosphorylation of P450c17 and the allosteric action of cytochrome b5, both of which act to optimize the interaction of P450c17 with its obligatory electron donor, P450 oxidoreductase.},

abstract = {From a database containing the published nuclear hormone receptor (NR) sequences I constructed an alignment of the C, D and E domains of these molecules. Using this alignment, I have performed tree reconstruction using both distance matrix and parsimony analysis. The robustness of each branch was estimated using bootstrap resampling methods. The trees constructed by these two methods gave congruent topologies. From these analyses I defined six NR subfamilies: (i) a large one clustering thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and ecdysone receptors (EcRs) as well as numerous orphan receptors such as RORs or Rev-erbs; (ii) one containing retinoid X receptors (RXRs) together with COUP, HNF4, tailless, TR2 and TR4 orphan receptors; (iii) one containing steroid receptors; (iv) one containing the NGFIB orphan receptors; (v) one containing FTZ-F1 orphan receptors; and finally (vi) one containing to date only one gene, the GCNF1 orphan receptor. The relationships between the six subfamilies are not known except for subfamilies I and IV which appear to be related. Interestingly, most of the liganded receptors appear to be derived when compared with orphan receptors. This suggests that the ligand-binding ability of NRs has been gained by orphan receptors during the course of evolution to give rise to the presently known receptors. The distribution into six subfamilies correlates with the known abilities of the various NRs to bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers. For example, receptors heterodimerizing efficiently with RXR belong to the first or the fourth subfamilies. I suggest that the ability to heterodimerize evolved once, just before the separation of subfamilies I and IV and that the first NR was able to bind to DNA as a homodimer. From the study of NR sequences existing in vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, I define two major steps of NR diversification: one that took place very early, probably during the multicellularization event leading to all the metazoan phyla, and a second occurring later on, corresponding to the advent of vertebrates. Finally, I show that in vertebrate species the various groups of NRs accumulated mutations at very different rates.},

abstract = {Multiple cofactors and chromatin remodeling complexes have been identified to contribute to the transcriptional activation regulated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in vitro. However, their role and function during development in vivo remains to be elucidated. The total dependence of amphibian metamorphosis on thyroid hormone T3 provides a unique vertebrate model for studying the molecular mechanism of TR function in vivo. In this study, we show that the expression of Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin-remodeling enzyme, is up-regulated at the climax of Xenopus laevis metamorphosis, whereas BRG1-associated factor 57 (BAF57), a BRG1-binding protein in BRG1-containing chromatin remodeling complexes, is constitutively expressed during development. Consistently, T3 treatment of premetamorphic tadpoles led to up-regulation of the expression of BRG1 but not BAF57. Studies using a reconstituted T3-dependent Xenopus oocyte transcription system, where we could study TR function in the context of chromatin, revealed that BRG1 enhances the transcriptional activation by ligand-bound TRs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a remodeling-defective BRG1 mutant inhibited the activation, suggesting that this process relies on chromatin remodeling. Additional studies showed that BAF57 interacted with BRG1 in oocytes and enhanced gene activation by TR cooperatively with BRG1 in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that BAF57 was recruited to the TR-regulated promoter in the presence of TR and T3. Together, these findings suggest a role of BRG1/BAF57-containing chromatin remodeling complexes in TR-regulated gene expression during postembryonic development.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones orchestrate amphibian metamorphosis. The type 2 and type 3 deiodinases make vital contributions to this process by controlling levels of the thyroid hormones T(4) and T(3) available to different tissues. Because the tadpole thyroid gland is not functional until stage NF44, it has been widely assumed that thyroid signaling is absent during amphibian early development, thyroid hormone only becoming a major regulator during premetamorphic stages. Similarly, in mammals, thyroid function is known to be essential to neuronal development, especially during the perinatal stages, but again little is known about early stages of development. Here we demonstrate that key elements of thyroid hormone signaling are present during early development of Xenopus. In particular, we find functional thyroid hormone-activating deiodinases and significant levels of their substrates, T(4) and T(3), during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, we have further characterized a recently identified deiodinase in amphibians, homologous to mammalian type 1 deiodinase (D1). This enzyme is expressed in marked, spatially defined patterns during embryogenesis. The patterns of expression of type 1 deiodinase are distinct from those of type 2 and type 3 deiodinases. Deiodinase expression is found in neurogenic areas from stage NF30 onward, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We conclude that both activating and inactivating deiodinases show dynamic patterns of expression during early embryogenesis in amphibians, particularly in neurogenic areas. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone signaling is a key component of early neuronal development in vertebrates.},

A putative transactivation sequence within this domain was analyzed by mutating individual residues to alanine. Mutant receptor carboxyl-terminal domains were tested coupled to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4. A single mutant receptor (E460A) showed normal hormone binding and activation, whereas several others (P453A, F455A, L456A, F459A) exhibited impaired transactivation which correlated with their reduced ligand binding. Two mutations (L454A, E457A) were able to dissociate these properties, generating transcriptionally defective mutant proteins with preserved hormone binding. A further conservative substitution (E457D) was also nonfunctional, and these three mutations were equally deleterious when tested in the context of full-length TR beta with a natural thyroid hormone response element containing promoter. This loss of activity was not due to altered DNA binding or expression of mutant receptors in cultured cells.

Our observations indicate that conserved hydrophobic (Leu454) and charged (Glu457) residues mediate AF-2 activity of TR beta, possibly via a co-activator that has yet to be identified.},

@article{Dostert2004,
abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) belongs to the steroid hormone receptor subclass of nuclear receptors and controls physiological processes through activation and repression of specific target genes. The ligand-activated receptor dimer activates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (glucocorticoid response element, GRE) in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-regulated genes. In contrast to the regulation of these classical GREs, the repression of negatively regulated target genes is mediated by negative GREs (nGRE), composite GREs or by transrepression. Due to their broad therapeutic spectrum and superior therapeutic effects glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective drugs used for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Unfortunately, long term systemic therapy with GCs is restricted due to their metabolic side effects. It is assumed that transrepression of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B is the main mechanism by which glucocorticoids mediate their anti-inflammatory activity, whereas the side effects of GCs are mainly mediated by GR-DNA-interaction either by activation or by negative regulation of gene expression. While trans-repression has been characterized in detail, the molecular mechanisms of DNA-dependent cis-repression remain unclear. In this review, we focus on current knowledge about nGRE-mediated target gene repression and the relevance and function of these genes for glucocorticoid action. Negative GREs contribute to the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (POMC and CRH), bone (osteocalcin) and skin (keratins) function, inflammation (IL-1beta), angiogenesis (proliferin) and lactation (prolactin). The discovery of the underlying mechanisms, especially the comparison to positive GREs and trans-repression may help in the future to discover and analyze novel selective GR agonists.},

abstract = {Maternal care influences hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function in the rat through epigenetic programming of glucocorticoid receptor expression. In humans, childhood abuse alters HPA stress responses and increases the risk of suicide. We examined epigenetic differences in a neuron-specific glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) promoter between postmortem hippocampus obtained from suicide victims with a history of childhood abuse and those from either suicide victims with no childhood abuse or controls. We found decreased levels of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, as well as mRNA transcripts bearing the glucocorticoid receptor 1F splice variant and increased cytosine methylation of an NR3C1 promoter. Patch-methylated NR3C1 promoter constructs that mimicked the methylation state in samples from abused suicide victims showed decreased NGFI-A transcription factor binding and NGFI-A-inducible gene transcription. These findings translate previous results from rat to humans and suggest a common effect of parental care on the epigenetic regulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression.},

abstract = {Cellular levels of messenger RNA encoding thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were measured in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus in male rats after chemical thyroidectomy and thyroid hormone replacement. TRH mRNA levels were measured by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using a 35S-labeled synthetic 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe and quantitative autoradiography. Chemical thyroidectomy, produced by the administration of 6-(n-propyl)-2-thiouracil (PrSur), reduced plasma thyroxine below detection limits and significantly increased TRH mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus. Treatment with exogenous L-triiodothyronine (T3) reduced TRH mRNA to the same level in both hypothyroid and euthyroid animals. Neither PrSur treatment nor T3 replacement influenced TRH mRNA levels in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated total RNA from pituitaries of these animals indicated that thyrotropin-beta mRNA levels were elevated after thyroidectomy and reduced by T3 treatment, showing that the pituitary-thyroid axis was indeed stimulated by PrSur treatment. These results suggest that thyroid hormones are involved, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the biosynthesis of TRH in the thyrotropic center of the hypothalamus.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (T3) plays an important role in gene regulation in the liver. Previous studies have been done in complex systems such as animal models, or in transformed malignant hepatic cell lines in which thyroid hormone receptor (TR) was over-expressed by co-transfection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize T3-responsive genes in a simple system, by using a non-transformed hepatic cell line that is able to express sufficient amounts of endogenous TRs. For this purpose we used the murine non-transformed hepatocyte cell line AML 12. We performed analyses using a cDNA microarray containing 15,000 murine genes. We found 12 genes to be up-regulated and 5 genes to be down-regulated in the presence of T3. For some of the genes not previously known to be regulated by T3, we confirmed the regulation by T3 using real-time PCR. Our data in AML 12 cells provide a simple and physiologically relevant system to study T3 action, without the influence of neoplastic transformation or artificial TR over-expression. Furthermore, our data describe novel T3 responsive genes and provide insight into the role of T3 in important processes such as cholesterol metabolism, bile acid secretion, oncogenesis, among others, that can be tested in future experiments in vivo.},

Recent advances in pharmacology and molecular biology have made the study of this remarkable process in the frog Xenopus laevis attractive to developmental biologists and endocrinologists alike. In particular, the availability of a straightforward transgenesis assay and the near completion of the Xenopus tropicalis genome are enabling significant advances to be made in our understanding of the major remaining problems of metamorphosis: the extraordinary tissue specificity of responses, the precise timing of morphological changes, the degree of cell autonomy of hormone responses and developmental competence.

Synthetic GCs are widely prescribed therapeutics for the treatment of numerous inflammatory disorders and cancers. The effects of GCs are mediated by their binding and activation of the GC receptor (GR), a transcription factor that is subject to hormone-dependent and -independent phosphorylation on several serine and threonine residues. The GR is phosphorylated by kinases such as MAPKs, CDKs, and GSK-3beta, and these modifications modulate the transcriptional activity of the GR within cells. Here, we discuss the phosphorylation status of the GR as a mechanism to dictate how cells will ultimately respond to GCs. In doing so, we will review current knowledge about each phosphorylated residue within the GR and their contributions to modulating GC signaling in normal homeostatic physiology and during the progression of disease.},

abstract = {Transport of thyroid hormone across the cell membrane is required for its action and metabolism. Recently, a T-type amino acid transporter was cloned which transports aromatic amino acids but not iodothyronines. This transporter belongs to the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family and is most homologous with MCT8 (SLC16A2). Therefore, we cloned rat MCT8 and tested it for thyroid hormone transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Oocytes were injected with rat MCT8 cRNA, and after 3 days immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of the protein at the plasma membrane. MCT8 cRNA induced an approximately 10-fold increase in uptake of 10 nM 125I-labeled thyroxine (T4), 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3), 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Because of the rapid uptake of the ligands, transport was only linear with time for <4 min. MCT8 did not transport Leu, Phe, Trp, or Tyr. [125I]T4 transport was strongly inhibited by L-T4, D-T4, L-T3, D-T3, 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid, N-bromoacetyl-T3, and bromosulfophthalein. T3 transport was less affected by these inhibitors. Iodothyronine uptake in uninjected oocytes was reduced by albumin, but the stimulation induced by MCT8 was markedly increased. Saturation analysis provided apparent Km values of 2-5 microM for T4, T3, and rT3. Immunohistochemistry showed high expression in liver, kidney, brain, and heart. In conclusion, we have identified MCT8 as a very active and specific thyroid hormone transporter.},

abstract = {Congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH) are inherited defects of cortisol biosynthesis. More than 90\% of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), found in 1:10 000 to 1:15 000 live births. Females with 'classical' 21-OHD, being exposed to excess androgens prenatally, are born with virilized external genitalia. Potentially lethal adrenal insufficiency is characteristic of two-thirds to three-quarters of patients with the classical salt wasting (SW) form of 21-OHD. Non-SW 21-OHD may be diagnosed on genital ambiguity in affected females, and/or later on the occurrence of androgen excess in both sexes. Non-classical 21-OHD, detected in > or =1:100 of certain populations, may present as precocious pubarche in children or polycystic ovarian syndrome in young women. 21-OHD is caused by mutations in the CYP21 gene encoding the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme. More than 90\% of these mutations result from intergenic recombination between CYP21 and the closely linked CYP21P pseudogene. The degree to which each mutation compromises enzymatic activity is strongly correlated with the clinical severity of the disorder. This close association between genotype and phenotype makes it possible to predict clinical outcome in affected subjects. The risk of SW and prenatal virilization can be estimated, and overtreatment can be avoided in mildly affected cases. Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapies are the mainstays of treatment, but additional therapies are being developed. A first trimester prenatal diagnosis should be proposed in families in whom molecular studies have been performed previously. The state of heterozygotism can be predicted by hormonal testing and confirmed by molecular studies. Prenatal diagnosis by direct mutation detection in previously genotyped families permits prenatal treatment of affected females in order to avoid or minimize genital virilization. Neonatal screening by hormonal methods identifies affected children before SW crises develop, reducing mortality in this disorder.},

abstract = {Transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors is achieved through autonomous activation functions (AFs), a constitutive N-terminal AF-1 and a C-terminal, ligand-dependent AF-2 that comprises a motif conserved between nuclear receptors. We have performed an extensive mutational analysis of the putative AF-2 domain of chicken thyroid hormone receptor alpha (cT3R alpha). We show that the AF-2 region mediates transactivation as well as transcriptional interference (squelching), not only between the thyroid hormone and vitamin (type II) receptors, but also between type II and steroid hormone (type I) receptors. Transcriptional activation and interference require equivalent doses of the cognate ligand, and mutations in the conserved motif that reduce ligand-induced transactivation also impair transcriptional interference. When fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, a 35 amino acid long fragment containing the conserved motif is able to transactivate and squelch, albeit in a ligand-independent manner. Our results define the AF-2 of cT3R alpha as an autonomous transactivation domain that, in its natural context, is governed by ligand. We propose that AF-2 is probably part of a surface for interaction with either a general transcription factor or a putative bridging factor, that might be utilized by type I and II receptors.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones (TH) play an important regulatory role in energy expenditure regulation and are key regulators of mitochondrial activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine (T3) receptor (p43) which acts as a mitochondrial transcription factor of the organelle genome, which leads in vitro and in vivo, to a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Recently, we generated mice carrying a specific p43 invalidation. At 2 months of age, we reported that p43 depletion in mice induced a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets, and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The present study was designed to determine whether p43 invalidation influences life expectancy and modulates blood glucose and insulin levels as well as glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity during aging. We report that from 4 months old onwards, mice lacking p43 are leaner than wild-type mice. p43-/- mice also have a moderate reduction of life expectancy compared to wild type. We found no difference in blood glucose levels, excepted at 24 months old where p43-/- mice showed a strong hyperglycemia in fasting conditions compared to controls animals. However, the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was maintained whatever the age of mice lacking p43. If up to 12 months old, glucose tolerance remained unchanged, beyond this age p43-/- mice became increasingly glucose intolerant. In addition, if up to 12 months old p43 deficient animals were more sensitive to insulin, after this age we observed a loss of this capacity, culminating in 24 months old mice with a decreased sensitivity to the hormone. In conclusion, we demonstrated that during aging the depletion of the mitochondrial T3 receptor p43 in mice progressively induced an increased glycemia in the fasted state, glucose intolerance and an insulin-resistance several features of type-2 diabetes.},

The target tissue action of this hormone is primarily mediated by the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-bound transcription factor. In developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, GR transcripts and cortisol are maternally deposited into the oocyte prior to fertilization and influence early embryogenesis. To better understand of the molecular mechanisms involved, we investigated changes in the developmental transcriptome prior to hatch, in response to morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of GR using the Agilent zebrafish microarray platform. A total of 1313 and 836 mRNA transcripts were significantly changed at 24 and 36 hours post fertilization (hpf), respectively. Functional analysis revealed numerous developmental processes under GR regulation, including neurogenesis, eye development, skeletal and cardiac muscle formation. Together, this study underscores a critical role for glucocorticoid signaling in programming molecular events essential for zebrafish development.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for an adequate growth and development of the kidney. Conversely, the kidney is not only an organ for metabolism and elimination of TH, but also a target organ of some of the iodothyronines' actions. Thyroid dysfunction causes remarkable changes in glomerular and tubular functions and electrolyte and water homeostasis. Hypothyroidism is accompanied by a decrease in glomerular filtration, hyponatremia, and an alteration of the ability for water excretion. Excessive levels of TH generate an increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. Renal disease, in turn, leads to significant changes in thyroid function. The association of different types of glomerulopathies with both hyper- and hypofunction of the thyroid has been reported. Less frequently, tubulointerstitial disease has been associated with functional thyroid disorders. Nephrotic syndrome is accompanied by changes in the concentrations of TH due primarily to loss of protein in the urine. Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are accompanied by notable effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. The secretion of pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) is impaired in uremia. Contrary to other non-thyroidal chronic disease, in uraemic patients it is not unusual to observe the sick euthyroid syndrome with low serum triodothyronine (T(3)) without elevation of reverse T(3) (rT(3)). Some authors have reported associations between thyroid cancer and kidney tumors and each of these organs can develop metastases into the other. Finally, data from recent research suggest that TH, especially T(3), can be considered as a marker for survival in patients with kidney disease.},

Levels and patterns of genetic variation differ greatly between obligatorily outbreeding species such as fruitflies and self-fertilizing species such as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Also, plant development is more plastic, being coupled to environmental cues. Here we report that, in Arabidopsis accessions and recombinant inbred lines, reducing Hsp90 function produces an array of morphological phenotypes, which are dependent on underlying genetic variation. The strength and breadth of Hsp90's effects on the buffering and release of genetic variation suggests it may have an impact on evolutionary processes. We also show that Hsp90 influences morphogenetic responses to environmental cues and buffers normal development from destabilizing effects of stochastic processes. Manipulating Hsp90's buffering capacity offers a tool for harnessing cryptic genetic variation and for elucidating the interplay between genotypes, environments and stochastic events in the determination of phenotype.},

The molecular mechanism underlying the enzymatic removal of this epigenetic mark, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylase TET1, by converting 5mCs to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmCs), promotes DNA demethylation in mammalian cells through a process that requires the base excision repair pathway. Though expression of the 12 known human DNA glycosylases individually did not enhance removal of 5hmCs in mammalian cells, demethylation of both exogenously introduced and endogenous 5hmCs is promoted by the AID (activation-induced deaminase)/APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme complex) family of cytidine deaminases. Furthermore, Tet1 and Apobec1 are involved in neuronal activity-induced, region-specific, active DNA demethylation and subsequent gene expression in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse brain in vivo. Our study suggests a TET1-induced oxidation-deamination mechanism for active DNA demethylation in mammals.},

@article{Larsen1982,
abstract = {Endocrinologists, particularly those with a special interest in thyroid disease, have been fortunate that several specific and sensitive tests that can establish the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction have been developed over the past decade. The three most useful tests are radioimmunoassays of thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Clinicians have come to have so much confidence in the results of these tests that they often question their clinical acumen rather than the validity of a test when the two conflict. Diagnosis in thyroid disorders thus can be difficult not only because of the nonspecificity of symptoms, but also because of discrepancies between the patient's metabolic status and the results of serologic studies. For example, how should the physician classify a clinically euthyroid, normally developing adolescent girl with thyroid enlargement, a reduced serum level of T4, a normal serum T3 level, and an elevated serum TSH level? Is she euthyroid because she has no clinical symptoms and a normal T3 concentration, or is she hypothyroid because of the elevation in TSH? When patients have elevated serum T4 and normal serum T3 concentrations after cholecystography, during treatment with amiodarone, or in the presence of severe systemic illness, are they euthyroid or do they have "T4 thyrotoxicosis"?1 2 3 4 Because physicians depend so much on measurements of the serum concentrations of T4, T3, and TSH to confirm a clinical impression of thyroid disease, it is important for the accurate interpretation of these results for physicians to have a thorough understanding of the interaction between the thyroid and the pituitary glands.},

abstract = {The diversity of thyroid hormone T(3) effects in vivo makes their molecular analysis particularly challenging. Indeed, the current model of the action of T(3) and its receptors on transcription does not reflect this diversity. Here, T(3)-dependent amphibian metamorphosis was exploited to investigate, in an in vivo developmental context, how T(3) directly regulates gene expression. Two, direct positively regulated T(3)-response genes encoding transcription factors were analyzed: thyroid hormone receptor $\beta$ (TR$\beta$) and TH/bZIP. Reverse transcription-real-time quantitative PCR analysis on Xenopus tropicalis tadpole brain and tail fin showed differences in expression levels in premetamorphic tadpoles (lower for TH/bZIP than for TR$\beta$) and differences in induction after T(3) treatment (lower for TR$\beta$ than for TH/bZIP). To dissect the mechanisms underlying these differences, chromatin immunoprecipitation was used. T(3) differentially induced RNA polymerase II and histone tail acetylation as a function of transcriptional level. Gene-specific patterns of TR binding were found on the different T(3) -responsive elements (higher for TR$\beta$ than for TH/bZIP), correlated with gene-specific modifications of H3K4 methylation (higher for TR$\beta$ than for TH/bZIP). Moreover, tissue-specific modifications of H3K27 were found (lower in brain than in tail fin). This first in vivo analysis of the association of histone modifications and TR binding/gene activation during vertebrate development for any nuclear receptor indicate that chromatin context of thyroid-responsive elements loci controls the capacity to bind TR through variations in histone H3K4 methylation, and that the histone code, notably H3, contributes to the fine tuning of gene expression that underlies complex physiological T(3) responses.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone exerts a pleiotropic effect on development and homeostasis. A novel thyroid hormone receptor beta isoform (hereafter referred to as TR beta 4) was cloned using PCR from a human pituitary cDNA library as a template. Analysis of the PCR products revealed a 137-bp insertion, which contains a stop codon in the middle, between the 5th and 6th exons that encode the ligand-binding domain of TR beta. The corresponding sequence of this insertion exists within the 5th intron of the human TR beta gene and consensus splice sequences were found at the junction sites. RACE analysis revealed that TR beta 4 is a carboxyl-terminal splicing variant of TR beta 1. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses indicate that TR beta 4 mRNA is expressed in various human tissues, and especially abundant in testis and skeletal muscle. The TR beta 4 protein was unable to bind thyroid hormone (T3) and transient transfection assays demonstrate that TR beta 4 construct does not mediate T3-dependent gene regulation. TR beta 4 weakly but significantly inhibited transcription mediated by functional TR. Thus, this novel isoform may modulate hormone action as an endogenous antagonist in the tissue or cellular context.},

abstract = {While general effects of glucocorticoids are well established, the specific cellular mechanisms by which these hormones exert tissue-dependent effects continue to be elaborated. Diseases that demonstrate altered glucocorticoid signaling have been associated with alterations in astrocytes, yet relatively little is known about the effects of glucocorticoids upon this cell type. We have analyzed mRNA expression patterns following glucocorticoid treatment of mouse primary astrocyte cultures. Microarray analysis of cortical astrocyte cultures treated with dexamethasone over an eight-point, 24 h time course identified 854 unique genes with ≥twofold change in mRNA expression at one or more time points. Clustering analysis associated subsets of these mRNA expression changes with gene ontology categories known to be impacted by glucocorticoids. Numerous mRNAs regulated by dexamethasone were also regulated by the natural ligand corticosterone; all of the mRNAs regulated ≥twofold by corticosterone were substantially attenuated by cotreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. Of the mRNAs demonstrating ≥twofold expression change in response to both glucocorticoids, 33 mRNAs were previously associated with glucocorticoid regulation, and 36 mRNAs were novel glucocorticoid targets. All genes tested by qPCR for glucocorticoid regulation in cortical astrocyte cultures were also regulated by glucocorticoids in hippocampal astrocyte cultures (18/18). Interestingly, a portion of glucocorticoid-regulated genes were astrocyte enriched; the percentage of astrocyte-enriched genes per total number of regulated genes was highest for the early time points and steadily decreased over the time course. These findings suggest that astrocytes in vitro may initially deploy cell type-specific patterns of mRNA regulatory responses to glucocorticoids and subsequently activate additional cell type-independent responses.},

abstract = {This study molecularly elucidates the basis for the dominant negative mechanism of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoform hGRbeta, whose overexpression is associated with human glucocorticoid resistance. Using a series of truncated hGRalpha mutants and sequential mutagenesis to generate a series of hGRalpha/beta hybrids, we find that the absence of helix 12 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the GR dominant negative phenotype. Moreover, we have localized the dominant negative activity of hGRbeta to two residues and found that nuclear localization, in addition to heterodimerization, is a critical feature of the dominant negative activity. Molecular modeling of wild-type and mutant hGRalpha and hGRbeta provides structural insight and a potential physical explanation for the lack of hormone binding and the dominant negative actions of hGRbeta.},

abstract = {Amphibian metamorphosis is marked by dramatic thyroid hormone (T(3))-induced changes including de novo morphogenesis, tissue remodeling, and organ resorption through programmed cell death. These changes involve cascades of gene regulation initiated by thyroid hormone (TH). TH functions by regulating gene expression through TH receptors (TR). TR are DNA-binding transcription factors that belong to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. In the absence of ligand, TR can repress gene expression by recruiting a corepressor complex, whereas liganded TR recruits a coactivator complex for gene activation. Earlier studies have led us to propose a dual function model for TR during development. In premetamorphic tadpoles, unliganded TR represses transcription involving corepressors. During metamorphosis, endogenous T(3) allows TR to activate gene expression. To fully understand the diversity of T(3) effects during metamorphosis, whole genome analysis of transcriptome and mechanism of TR action should be carried out. To this end, the new sequencing technologies have dramatically changed how fundamental questions in biology are being addressed and is now making the transition from technology development to being a standard for genomic and functional genomic analysis. This review focuses on the applications of high-throughput technologies to the field of amphibian metamorphosis.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of thyroid hormone (T(3)) on neurite outgrowth are unknown. We recently identified the small GC-box binding protein BTEB (basic transcription element-binding protein) as a T(3)-regulated gene in the developing rat brain. BTEB mRNAs are rapidly (by 1 h) up-regulated by T(3) in primary rat embryonic neuronal cultures. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), added to the cultures, reduced by 60\% the level of BTEB mRNA. Addition of BTEB antisense ODNs to the cultures, before the onset of neurite polarity, had no effect on neurite elaboration but significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, the effect of T(3) on neurite branching. We then examined the effects of antisense ODNs on a thyroid hormone target neuronal population, i.e. the acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons after the onset of neurite polarity. Exposure to BTEB antisense ODNs completely abolished the effects of T(3) on neurite branching and on the elaboration of neuritic filopodia-like structures in acetylcholinesterase cells. By contrast, antisense ODNs did not alter the effect of T(3) on neurite length. Our results show that titration of BTEB levels by T(3) regulates the degree of neurite branching and that the T(3)-induced neurite elongation and the T(3)-induced neurite branching are regulated by distinct mechanisms.},

In one complex, the DNA has the symmetrical consensus target sequence; in the second, the central spacing between the target's half-sites is larger by one base pair. This results in one subunit interacting specifically with the consensus target half-site and the other nonspecifically with a noncognate element. The DNA-induced dimer fixes the separation of the subunits' recognition surfaces so that the spacing between the half-sites becomes a critical feature of the target sequence's identity.},

RNA from several human adrenal samples was translated in vitro and immunoprecipitated with anti-bovine P450scc, indicating that P450scc mRNA represents about 0.5\% of human adrenal mRNA in normal, hypertrophied, and malignant adrenals. A 1626-base-pair human adrenal P450scc cDNA was cloned in bacteriophage lambda gt10. Primer extension data indicated P450scc mRNA is about 1850 bases long and that all adrenal P450scc mRNA has the same 5' end. A full-length clone containing 1821 bases was obtained from a human testis cDNA library to yield the complete sequence. The encoded human preP450scc contains 521 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60189.65. The testis and adrenal sequences were identical; the human cDNA and amino acid sequences are 82\% and 72\% homologous, respectively, with the bovine sequences. P450scc cDNA was used to probe DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, showing that the single human P450scc gene lies on chromosome 15. The human P450scc gene is expressed in the placenta in early and midgestation; primary cultures of placental tissue indicate P450scc mRNA accumulates in response to cyclic AMP.},

abstract = {A glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited the production of a leukocyte chemotactic cytokine, interleukin 8 (IL-8), as well as mRNA expression by a glioblastoma cell line, T98G, stimulated with interleukin 1 (IL-1). Dexamethasone also inhibited IL-8 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities induced by IL-1, suggesting that dexamethasone inhibited IL-8 production mainly at the transcriptional level. Moreover, CAT assay revealed that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) binding site was the crucial cis-element required for conferring IL-1 responsiveness in conjunction with the CCAAT enhancer binding protein/nuclear factor-IL-6 (NF-IL6) and/or the AP-1 binding site(s). Mutation of either the AP-1 or NF-IL6 binding site did not abolish IL-8 gene repression by dexamethasone, suggesting that these sites were not targets for dexamethasone. Trimerized kappa B sequence in the IL-8 gene was enough for conferring the induction by IL-1 and inhibition by dexamethasone of CAT activity. Finally, dexamethasone diminished the IL-1-induced formation of NF-kappa B complexes, which were identified immunochemically to consist of p50 and p65, without reducing the amount of translocated factors. Collectively, dexamethasone interfered with the binding of the most essential transcription factor, NF-kappa B, to its cognate cis-element, thereby suppressing the transcription of IL-8 gene.},

abstract = {The roles in DNA binding and transcriptional activation of individual amino acids in the putative recognition alpha-helix of the first zinc finger of the beta-isoform of the human thyroid hormone receptor (hT3R beta) have been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Alanine substitutions of highly conserved residues involved in the folding of this zinc finger abolished the binding of hT3R beta to various thyroid response elements. A similar effect was observed for alanine substitutions of those conserved residues in hT3R beta that were expected to make specific contacts to DNA bases common to all hormone response elements. The three P-box amino acids have previously been shown to be essential for discrimination of the base pairs that differ between the DNA binding sites for related steroid/thyroid hormone receptors. In hT3R beta, the P-box residues are E, G, and G; the results of this study show that alanine substitution of the glutamic acid dramatically reduces DNA binding activity by hT3R beta, while the substitution of either glycine has little or no effect on DNA binding. The effects of alanine substitutions on hT3R beta transcriptional activation properties were consistent with the effect of these substitutions on DNA binding properties, with the exception of the second P-box amino acid. T3R beta substituted with alanine at this position is substantially more defective in transcriptional activation than it is in specific DNA binding. These results indicate that there are two separate mechanisms of response element discrimination by P-box amino acids of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, one which operates at the level of DNA recognition and a second which operates at the level of transcriptional activation.},

abstract = {Gene regulation by steroid hormones is mediated by binding of the hormone ligand to the corresponding receptor that triggers a complex set of interactions of the hormone receptors with each other, with DNA in chromatin, and with a variety of other proteins. In this review we attempt to summarize what is known about these interactions using as the main example the regulation of mouse mammary tumor virus transcription by glucocorticoids and progestins. We describe in some detail the interaction of monomers and homodimers of the steroid receptors with their recognition sequences, and the molecular mechanism used to discriminate between the responsive elements for glucocorticoids/progestins and estrogens. We then review the interactions between homologous and heterologous hormone receptors on complex hormone regulatory regions, before devoting some attention to the synergistic and inhibitory interactions of hormone receptors with other transcription factors. Finally we briefly summarize some of the possible mechanisms that modulate the molecular interactions of hormone receptors. In addition to ligand binding, these include receptor phosphorylation, changes in DNA topology, and the organization of DNA in nucleosomes. From this overview we draw the tentative conclusion that the specificity of the hormonal response in different cells results from a combination of developmental restrictions both in the accessibility of genomic sequence and in the repertoire of regulatory proteins present in each particular cell. In addition, the array of regulatory sequences in DNA and chromatin determines the precise nature of macromolecular interactions of the receptors that are modulated by their degree of phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Signal transduction pathways enable extracellular signals to activate latent transcription factors in the cytoplasm of cells. Dimerization, nuclear localization and binding to specific DNA sequences result in the induction of gene transcription by these proteins. These events are necessary for the functioning of the JAK/STAT pathway and of the glucocorticoid-receptor pathway. In the former, the protein Stat5, which is a member of a family of signal transducers and activators of transcription, is activated by cytokines, hormones and growth factors. These polypeptide ligands bind at the outside of the cell to specific transmembrane receptors and activate intracellular Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) to tyrosine-phosphorylate STAT proteins; interaction with the SH2 domain of the dimerization partner then confers the ability to bind to DNA at the STAT-response element and induce transcription. In the glucocorticoid-receptor pathway, the receptor interacts with its steroid hormone ligand in the cytoplasm, undergoes an allosteric change that enables the hormone receptor complex to bind to specific DNA-response elements (glucocorticoid response elements, or GRE) and modulate transcription. Although these pathways appear to be unrelated, we show here that the glucocorticoid receptor can act as a transcriptional co-activator for Stat5 and enhance Stat5-dependent transcription. Stat5 forms a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor which binds to DNA independently of the GRE. This complex formation between Stat5 and the glucocorticoid receptor diminishes the glucocorticoid response of a GRE-containing promoter.},

abstract = {Acute hormonal regulation of liver carbohydrate metabolism mainly involves changes in the cytosolic levels of cAMP and Ca2+. Epinephrine, acting through beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and glucagon activate adenylate cyclase in the liver plasma membrane through a mechanism involving a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is stimulatory to the enzyme. The resulting accumulation of cAMP leads to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates many intracellular enzymes involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis. These are (1) phosphorylase b kinase, which is activated and, in turn, phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen breakdown; (2) glycogen synthase, which is inactivated and is rate-controlling for glycogen synthesis; (3) pyruvate kinase, which is inactivated and is an important regulatory enzyme for glycolysis; and (4) the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase bifunctional enzyme, phosphorylation of which leads to decreased formation of fructose 2,6-P2, which is an activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and an inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, both of which are important regulatory enzymes for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In addition to rapid effects of glucagon and beta-adrenergic agonists to increase hepatic glucose output by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glycogen synthesis and glycolysis, these agents produce longer-term stimulatory effects on gluconeogenesis through altered synthesis of certain enzymes of gluconeogenesis/glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. For example, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is induced through an effect at the level of transcription mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Tyrosine amino-transferase, serine dehydratase, tryptophan oxygenase, and glucokinase are also regulated by cAMP, in part at the level of specific messenger RNA synthesis. The sympathetic nervous system and its neurohumoral agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine also rapidly alter hepatic glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis acting through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The primary response to these agonists is the phosphodiesterase-mediated breakdown of the plasma membrane polyphosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 to inositol 1,4,5-P3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol. This involves a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is different from those involved in the regulation of adenylate cyclase. Inositol 1,4,5-P3 acts as an intracellular messenger for Ca2+ mobilization by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Activated nongenomically by l-thyroxine (T(4)), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complexed in 10-20 min with endogenous nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TRbeta1 or TR) in nuclear fractions of 293T cells, resulting in serine phosphorylation of TR. Treatment of cells with the MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, prevented both T(4)-induced nuclear MAPK-TR co-immunoprecipitation and serine phosphorylation of TR. T(4) treatment caused dissociation of TR and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor), an effect also inhibited by PD 98059 and presumptively a result of association of nuclear MAPK with TR. Transfection into CV-1 cells of TR gene constructs in which one or both zinc fingers in the TR DNA-binding domain were replaced with those from the glucocorticoid receptor localized the site of TR phosphorylation by T(4)-activated MAPK to a serine in the second zinc finger of the TR DNA-binding domain. In an in vitro cell- and hormone-free system, purified activated MAPK phosphorylated recombinant human TRbeta1 (). Thus, T(4) activates MAPK and causes MAPK-mediated serine phosphorylation of TRbeta1 and dissociation of TR and the co-repressor SMRT.},

@article{Aranda2001,
abstract = {The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily includes receptors for thyroid and steroid hormones, retinoids and vitamin D, as well as different "orphan" receptors of unknown ligand. Ligands for some of these receptors have been recently identified, showing that products of lipid metabolism such as fatty acids, prostaglandins, or cholesterol derivatives can regulate gene expression by binding to nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors act as ligand-inducible transcription factors by directly interacting as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor with DNA response elements of target genes, as well as by "cross-talking" to other signaling pathways. The effects of nuclear receptors on transcription are mediated through recruitment of coregulators. A subset of receptors binds corepressor factors and actively represses target gene expression in the absence of ligand. Corepressors are found within multicomponent complexes that contain histone deacetylase activity. Deacetylation leads to chromatin compactation and transcriptional repression. Upon ligand binding, the receptors undergo a conformational change that allows the recruitment of multiple coactivator complexes. Some of these proteins are chromatin remodeling factors or possess histone acetylase activity, whereas others may interact directly with the basic transcriptional machinery. Recruitment of coactivator complexes to the target promoter causes chromatin decompactation and transcriptional activation. The characterization of corepressor and coactivator complexes, in concert with the identification of the specific interaction motifs in the receptors, has demonstrated the existence of a general molecular mechanism by which different receptors elicit their transcriptional responses in target genes.},

@article{Angelier2013,
abstract = {In this perspective paper, we emphasize the importance that integrative mechanisms, and especially the GC (glucocorticoid) stress response, can play in the ability of vertebrates to cope with ongoing global change. The GC stress response is an essential mediator of allostasis (i.e., the responses of an organism to a perturbation) that aims at maintaining stability (homeostasis) despite changing conditions. The GC stress response is a complex mechanism that depends on several physiological components and aims at promoting immediate survival at the expense of other life-history components (e.g., reproduction) when a labile perturbation factor (LPF) occurs. Importantly, this mechanism is somewhat flexible and its degree of activation can be adjusted to the fitness costs and benefits that result from the GC stress response. Therefore, this GC stress response mediates life-history decisions and is involved in the regulation of important life-history trade-offs. By inducing abrupt and rapid changes in the regime of LPFs, we believe that global change can affect the efficiency of the GC stress response to maintain homeostasis and to appropriately regulate these trades-offs. This dysfunction may result in an important mismatch between new LPFs and the associated GC stress response and, thus, in the inability of vertebrates to cope with a changing world. In that context, it is essential to better understand how the GC stress response can be adjusted to new LPFs through micro-evolution, phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic flexibility (habituation and sensitization). This paper sets up a theoretical framework, hypotheses and new perspectives that will allow testing and better understanding how the GC stress response can help or constrain individuals, populations and species to adjust to ongoing global change.},

abstract = {Serum concentrations of T4, T3, and rT3 as well as liver and kidney 5'-deiodinase activity, have been examined in rats stressed by restraint. After immobilization, serum concentrations of T3 decreased significantly (6 hr, -33 +/- 1\%; 8 h, -42 +/- 3\%), while serum rT3 increased (6 h, +55 +/- 3\%; 8 h, +75 +/- 5\%). In the same or similarly treated animals, there was a time-dependent reduction in T4 5'-deiodinase activity in both liver (4 h, -23 +/- 2\%; 8 h, -43 +/- 3\%) and kidney (4 h, -18 +/- 1\%; 8 h, -42 +/- 3\%) homogenates. The reduction in hepatic and renal T3 production was due to reduced enzyme activity and not to reduced substrate availability. In spite of reductions in serum TSH (4 h, -9 +/- 1\%; 8 h, -51 +/- 5\%), the serum T4 concentration did not fall. The serum concentration of corticosterone reached 30 times the basal level after 8 h of restraint. Either adrenalectomy or metyrapone treatment, followed by replacement with nonstress doses of B, completely prevented the alterations of iodothyronine metabolism induced by restraint. These results indicate that the stress-induced elevation of plasma glucocorticoids plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the low T3 syndrome in this model. The reduction in serum T3 may be accounted for by a reduction in T3 production by liver and kidney, adding support to the concept that these organs are an important source of plasma T3 in the rat.},

abstract = {Heat shock proteins (HSP) are components of the steroid receptor complex and are released into the cell cytosol after hormone binding. We tested whether HSPs released from steroid receptors mediate an increase in calcineurin phosphatase activity by steroid hormones. Aldosterone increased calcineurin activity in microdissected rat cortical collecting ducts (CCD) and connecting tubules, but not in proximal tubules, medullary thick ascending limb, or outer medullary collecting ducts. In contrast, 5 microM dexamethasone increased calcineurin activity in both CCD and proximal tubules. Aldosterone increased CCD calcineurin activity after 30 min and this response was blocked by spironolactone, but not by actinomycin D. An antibody recognizing HSP-56 did not change basal calcineurin activity, but completely blocked the stimulation of calcineurin by aldosterone. Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug that stabilizes the HSP-steroid receptor complex, also blocked the aldosterone response, whereas HSP-90 or HSP-70 increased calcineurin activity in permeabilized CCD. In summary, (a) aldosterone increases calcineurin activity in CCD through a transcription-independent process; (b) maneuvers inactivating HSP-56 or slowing HSP disassociation from the receptor complex blocks stimulation of calcineurin by steroid hormones; (c) HSP-90 and HSP-70 increase CCD calcineurin activity in the absence of steroid hormone. We conclude that HSPs released from transformed steroid receptors can stimulate calcineurin activity through a transcription-independent pathway.},

abstract = {In recent years, integrative animal biologists and behavioral scientists have begun to understand the complex interactions between the immune system and the neuroendocrine system. Amphibian metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to study dramatic hormone-driven changes in the immune system in a compressed time frame. In the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, the larval pattern of immunity is distinct from that of the adult, and metamorphosis marks the transition from one pattern to the other. Climax of metamorphosis is characterized by significant elevations in thyroid hormones, glucocorticoid hormones, and the pituitary hormones, prolactin and growth hormone. Previously, we and others have shown that elevated levels of unbound glucocorticoid hormones found at climax of metamorphosis are associated with a natural decline in lymphocyte numbers, lymphocyte viability, and mitogen-induced proliferation. Here we present evidence that the mechanism for loss of lymphocytes at metamorphosis is glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of lymphocyte function and loss of lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen are reversible by in vitro or in vivo treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, whereas the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU26752, is poorly effective. These observations support the hypothesis that loss of larval lymphocytes and changes in lymphocyte function are due to elevated concentrations of glucocorticoids that remove unnecessary lymphocytes to allow for development of immunological tolerance to the new adult-specific antigens that appear as a result of metamorphosis.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) plays a causative role in anuran metamorphosis. This effect is presumed to be manifested through the regulation of gene expression by TH receptors (TRs). TRs can act as both activators and repressors of a TH-inducible gene depending upon the presence and absence of TH, respectively. We have been investigating the roles of TRs during Xenopus laevis development, including premetamorphic and metamorphosing stages. In this review, we summarize some of the studies on the TRs by others and us. These studies reveal that TRs have dual functions in frog development as reflected in the following two aspects. First, TRs function initially as repressors of TH-inducible genes in premetamorphic tadpoles to prevent precocious metamorphosis, thus ensuring a proper period of tadpole growth, and later as activators of these genes to activate the metamorphic process. Second, TRs can promote both cell proliferation and apoptosis during metamorphosis, depending upon the cell type in which they are expressed.},

The DNA sequences recognized specifically by the hormone-receptor complex correspond directly to those required for GRE enhancement. The structural transition that accompanies steroid binding, 'receptor transformation', has been monitored by changes in receptor chromatographic properties, accessibility to monoclonal antibodies, association with other receptor subunits or with heterologous proteins, and aqueous two-phase partition coefficient. However, the significance of the structural change for the biological activity of the receptor is not understood. We have used cloned rat glucocorticoid-receptor coding sequences to produce and characterize a novel class of receptor mutants that elicit GRE enhancer function in transfected cells even in the absence of hormone. The constitutive activity of those receptor derivatives, together with mapping studies that distinguish between the DNA- and hormone-binding domains of the receptor, imply that the conformational change corresponding to receptor transformation may simply unmask pre-existing functional domains for DNA binding, enhancer activation, or both.},

abstract = {Cellular entry of thyroid hormone is mediated by plasma membrane transporters, among others a T-type (aromatic) amino acid transporter. Monocarboxylate transporter 10 (MCT10) has been reported to transport aromatic amino acids but not iodothyronines. Within the MCT family, MCT10 is most homologous to MCT8, which is a very important iodothyronine transporter but does not transport amino acids. In view of this paradox, we decided to reinvestigate the possible transport of thyroid hormone by human (h) MCT10 in comparison with hMCT8. Transfection of COS1 cells with hMCT10 cDNA resulted in 1) the production of an approximately 55 kDa protein located to the plasma membrane as shown by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy, 2) a strong increase in the affinity labeling of intracellular type I deiodinase by N-bromoacetyl-[(125)I]T(3), 3) a marked stimulation of cellular T(4) and, particularly, T(3) uptake, 4) a significant inhibition of T(3) uptake by phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan of 12.5\%, 22.2\%, and 51.4\%, respectively, and 5) a marked increase in the intracellular deiodination of T(4) and T(3) by different deiodinases. Cotransfection studies using the cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein micro-crystallin (CRYM) indicated that hMCT10 facilitates both cellular uptake and efflux of T(4) and T(3). In the absence of CRYM, hMCT10 and hMCT8 increased T(3) uptake after 5 min incubation up to 4.0- and 1.9-fold, and in the presence of CRYM up to 6.9- and 5.8-fold, respectively. hMCT10 was less active toward T(4) than hMCT8. These findings establish that hMCT10 is at least as active a thyroid hormone transporter as hMCT8, and that both transporters facilitate iodothyronine uptake as well as efflux.},

abstract = {When stimuli from the environment are perceived to be a threat or potential threat then animals initiate stress responses, with activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and secretion of glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol and corticosterone). Whilst standard deviation or standard error values are always reported, it is only when graphs of individual responses are shown that the extensive variation between animals is apparent. Some animals have little or no response to a stressor that evokes a relatively large response in others. Glucocorticoid responses of fish, amphibian, reptiles, birds, and mammals are considered in this review. Comparisons of responses between animals and groups of animals focused on responses to restraint or confinement as relatively standard stressors. Individual graphs could not be found in the literature for glucocorticoid responses to capture or restraint in fish or reptiles, with just one graph in mammals with the first sample was collected when animals were initially restrained. Coefficients of variation (CVs) calculated for parameters of glucocorticoid stress responses showed that the relative magnitudes of variation were similar in different vertebrate groups. The overall mean CV for glucocorticoid concentrations in initial (0 min) samples was 74.5\%, and CVs for samples collected over various times up to 4 h were consistently between 50\% and 60\%. The factors that lead to the observed individual variation and the extent to which this variation is adaptive or non-adaptive are little known in most animals, and future studies of glucocorticoid responses in animals can focus on individual responses and their origins and significance.},

We investigated the role played by chromatin infrastructure in enabling an acute response of the Xenopus TRbetaA gene to thyroid hormone receptor (TR), an extensively studied member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. We found that in addition to the known TR response element (TRE) in the promoter, full range regulation required an upstream enhancer that contained multiple nonconsensus TREs and augmented ligand action at high receptor levels. An array of translationally positioned nucleosomes formed over the TRbetaA locus in vivo; unliganded TR engaged this array in linker DNA between two nucleosomes and via TREs on the surface of histone octamers. Remarkably, assembly of enhancer DNA into mature chromatin potentiated binding by TR to its target response elements and enabled a greater range of regulation by TR than was observed on immature chromatin templates. Because assembly of enhancer DNA into chromatin increased TR binding to the nonconsensus TREs, we hypothesize that chromatin disruption targeted by liganded TR to the enhancer may lead to receptor release from the template and to an attenuation of response to hormone.},

abstract = {Environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity allows developing organisms to respond adaptively to changes in their habitat. Desert amphibians have evolved traits which allow successful development in unpredictable environments. Tadpoles of these species can accelerate metamorphosis as their pond dries, thus escaping mortality in the larval habitat. This developmental response can be replicated in the laboratory, which allows elucidation of the underlying physiological mechanisms. Here I demonstrate a link between a classical neurohormonal stress pathway (involving corticotropin-releasing hormone, CRH) and the developmental response to habitat desiccation. Injections of CRH-like peptides accelerated metamorphosis in western spadefoot toad tadpoles. Conversely, treatment with two CRH antagonists, the CRH receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRH(9-41) and anti-CRH serum, attenuated the developmental acceleration induced by habitat desiccation. Tadpoles subjected to habitat desiccation exhibited elevated hypothalamic CRH content at the time when they responded developmentally to the declining water level. CRH injections elevated whole-body thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and corticosterone content, the primary hormonal regulators of metamorphosis. In contrast, alpha-helical CRH(9-41) reduced thyroid activity. These results support a central role for CRH as a neurohormonal transducer of environmental stimuli into the endocrine response which modulates the rate of metamorphosis. Because in mammals, increased fetal/placental CRH production may initiate parturition, and CRH has been implicated in precipitating preterm birth arising from fetal stress, this neurohormonal pathway may represent a phylogenetically ancient developmental regulatory system that allows the organism to escape an unfavorable larval/fetal habitat.},

abstract = {Many amphibian species exploit temporary or even ephemeral aquatic habitats for reproduction by maximising larval growth under benign conditions but accelerating development to rapidly undergo metamorphosis when at risk of desiccation from pond drying. Here we determine mechanisms enabling developmental acceleration in response to decreased water levels in western spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes), a species with long larval periods and large size at metamorphosis but with a high degree of developmental plasticity. We found that P. cultripes tadpoles can shorten their larval period by an average of 30\% in response to reduced water levels. We show that such developmental acceleration was achieved via increased endogenous levels of corticosterone and thyroid hormone, which act synergistically to achieve metamorphosis, and also by increased expression of the thyroid hormone receptor TRΒ, which increases tissue sensitivity and responsivity to thyroid hormone. However, developmental acceleration had morphological and physiological consequences. In addition to resulting in smaller juveniles with proportionately shorter limbs, tadpoles exposed to decreased water levels incurred oxidative stress, indicated by increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Such increases were apparently sufficient to neutralise the oxidative damage caused by presumed increased metabolic activity. Thus, developmental acceleration allows spadefoot toad tadpoles to evade drying ponds, but it comes at the expense of reduced size at metamorphosis and increased oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Prenatal synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) are administered to pregnant women at risk of delivering preterm, approximately 10\% of all pregnancies. Animal studies have demonstrated that offspring exposed to elevated glucocorticoids, either by administration of sGC or as a result of maternal stress, are at increased risk of developing behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities. DNA methylation is a covalent modification of DNA that plays a critical role in long-lasting programming of gene expression. Here we tested the hypothesis that prenatal sGC treatment has both acute and long-term effects on DNA methylation states in the fetus and offspring and that these effects extend into a subsequent generation. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with sGC in late gestation, and methylation analysis by luminometric methylation assay was undertaken in organs from fetuses and offspring across two generations. Expression of genes that modify the epigenetic state were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Results indicate that there are organ-specific developmental trajectories of methylation in the fetus and newborn. Furthermore, these trajectories are substantially modified by intrauterine exposure to sGC. These sGC-induced changes in DNA methylation remain into adulthood and are evident in the next generation. Furthermore, prenatal sGC exposure alters the expression of several genes encoding proteins that modulate the epigenetic state. Several of these changes are long lasting and are also present in the next generation. These data support the hypothesis that prenatal sGC exposure leads to broad changes in critical components of the epigenetic machinery and that these effects can pass to the next generation.},

abstract = {Triiodothyronine (T3) is considered a major regulator of mitochondrial activity. In this review, we show evidence of the existence of a direct T3 mitochondrial pathway, and try to clarify the respective importance of the nuclear and mitochondrial pathways for organelle activity. Numerous studies have reported short-term and delayed T3 stimulation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Convincing data indicate that an early influence occurs through an extra-nuclear mechanism insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis. Although it has been shown that diiodothyronines could actually be T3 mediators of this short-term influence, the detection of specific T3-binding sites, probably corresponding to a 28 kDa c-Erb Aalpha1 protein of the inner membrane, also supports a direct T3 influence. The more delayed influence of thyroid hormone upon mitochondrial respiration probably results from mechanisms elicited at the nuclear level, including changes in phospholipid turnover and stimulation of uncoupling protein expression, leading to an increased inner membrane proton leak. However, the involvement of a direct mitochondrial T3 pathway leading to a rapid stimulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis has to be considered. Both pathways are obviously involved in the T3 stimulation of mitochondrial genome transcription. First, a 43 kDa c-Erb Aalpha1 protein located in the mitochondrial matrix (p43), acting as a potent T3-dependent transcription factor of the mitochondrial genome, induces early stimulation of organelle transcription. In addition, T3 increases mitochondrial TFA expression, a mitochondrial transcription factor encoded by a nuclear gene. Similarly, the stimulation of mitochondriogenesis by thyroid hormone probably involves both pathways. In particular, the c-erb Aalpha gene simultaneously encodes a nuclear and a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43), thus ensuring coordination of the expression of the mitochondrial genome and of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Recent studies concerning the physiological importance of the direct mitochondrial T3 pathway involving p43 led to the conclusion that it is not only involved in the regulation of fuel metabolism, but also in the regulation of cell differentiation. As the processes leading to or resulting from differentiation are energy-consuming, p43 coordination of metabolism and differentiation could be of significant importance in the regulation of development.},

abstract = {Glucuronidation of iodothyronines in rat liver is catalyzed by at least three UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs): bilirubin UGT, phenol UGT, and androsterone UGT. Bilirubin and phenol UGT activities are regulated by thyroid hormone, but the effect of thyroid status on hepatic glucuronidation of iodothyronines is unknown. We examined the effects of hypothyroidism induced by treatment of rats with propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole (MMI) or by thyroidectomy as well as the effects of T4-induced hyperthyroidism on the hepatic UGT activities for T4, T3, bilirubin,p-nitrophenol (PNP), and androsterone. Bilirubin UGT activity was increased in MMI- or PTU-induced hypothyroid and thyroidectomized rats, and decreased in hyperthyroid animals. T4 and, to a lesser extent, T3 UGT activities were increased in MMI- or PTU-induced hypothyroid rats, and T4 but not T3 glucuronidation also showed a significant increase in thyroidectomized rats. T4 but not T3 UGT activity was slightly decreased in hyperthyroid rats. While PNP UGT activity was decreased in thyroidectomized rats and increased in hyperthyroid animals, it was also markedly increased by MMI and slightly increased by PTU-induced hypothyroidism. In T4-substituted rats, MMI did not affect T4, T3, bilirubin and androsterone UGT activities but again strongly induced PNP UGT activity, indicating that this represented a direct induction of PNP UGT by the drug independent of its thyrostatic action. Androsterone UGT activity was hardly affected by thyroid status. Our results suggest a modest, negative control of the hepatic glucuronidation of thyroid hormone by thyroid status, which may be mediated by changes in bilirubin UGT activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the marked induction of a hepatic enzyme by MMI, which is not mediated by its thyroid hormone-lowering effect.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSHoma) show inappropriate secretion of TSH; serum TSH levels are not suppressed despite high serum free thyroid hormone levels. The mechanism of a defect in negative regulation of TSH in a TSHoma is still unclear.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, we cloned a novel thyroid hormone receptor $\beta$ isoform (TR$\beta$4) from a human pituitary library. To elucidate the clinical significance of TR$\beta$4, we investigated the expression of this isoform in TSHoma.

METHODS: RT-PCR was performed to detect TR$\beta$ isoforms such as TR$\beta$1, TR$\beta$2, and TR$\beta$4 using RNA obtained from surgically resected TSHoma. The effects of TR$\beta$4 on the TSH gene expression were examined in the transient gene expression experiments.

RESULTS: Quantitative analysis using a real-time PCR revealed that relative expression of TR$\beta$4 to TR$\beta$1+2 was higher in three TSHoma than in a prolactinoma or a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. TR$\beta$4 construct did not mediate T(3)-dependent gene regulation but inhibited the negative regulation of TSH$\alpha$ mediated by TR$\beta$1 or TR$\beta$2.

CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant expression of TR$\beta$4 may partly contribute to the inappropriate secretion of TSH in a TSHoma.},

They act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to and represses activities of other DNA-bound regulators, activator protein 1 and nuclear factor kappaB, utilizing a p160 GRIP1 as a corepressor. A yeast two-hybrid screen with the GRIP1 corepression domain (RD) yielded interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)3-a downstream effector of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3/4 and an essential activator of several IFN and chemokine genes. We defined the GRIP1:IRF3 interface and showed that endogenous GRIP1 and IRF3 interact in mammalian cells. Interestingly, GR and IRF3 competed for GRIP1 binding; GR activation or GRIP1 knockdown in macrophages blocked whereas GRIP1 overexpression rescued IRF3-dependent gene expression. GR interference persisted in MyD88- and IFNA receptor-deficient mice, suggesting a specific disruption of TLR3-IRF3 pathway, not of autocrine IFN signaling. Finally, IRF3-stimulated response elements were necessary and sufficient for TLR3-dependent induction and glucocorticoid inhibition. Thus, GRIP1 plays a cofactor role in innate immunity. Competition with GR for GRIP1 antagonizes IRF3-mediated transcription, identifying the GRIP1:IRF3 interaction as a novel target for glucocorticoid immunosuppression.},

In liver, lung, and kidney, TRalpha mRNA was expressed in the stromal and TRbeta mRNA in the parenchymal component of the tissues. When compared with liver, TRalpha mRNA concentrations were tenfold higher in lung, kidney, and intestine, and 100-fold higher in brain, with TRalpha (2) mRNA concentrations exceeding those of TRalpha (1) 5-to 10-fold. Tissue TRbeta (1) mRNA concentrations were similar in liver, lung, and brain, and 3- to 5-fold higher in kidney and intestine. None of the TRbeta (2) mRNA could be detected outside the pituitary. Tissue TRalpha (2) and TRbeta (1) protein levels reached adult levels at 5 days before birth, whereas TRalpha (1) protein peaked after birth. Because of the distinct time-course of thyroid hormone-binding receptors TRalpha (1) and TRbeta (1), we speculate that an initiating, TRbeta (1)-mediated signaling from the parenchyma is followed by a TRalpha (1)-mediated response in the stroma. When compared with organs with a complementary parenchymal-stromal expression pattern, organs with extensive cellular co-expression of TRalpha and TRbeta (brain and intestinal epithelium) were characterized by a very low TRalpha protein: mRNA ratio, implying a low translational efficiency of TR mRNA or a high turnover of TR protein. The data indicate that the TR-dependent regulatory cascades are controlled differently in organs with a complementary tissue expression pattern and in those with cellular co-expression of the TRalpha and TRbeta genes.},

abstract = {Although glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to exert numerous effects in the hippocampus, their chronic regulatory functions remain poorly understood. Moreover, evidence is inconsistent regarding the long-standing hypothesis that chronic GC exposure promotes brain aging/Alzheimer disease. Here, we adrenalectomized male F344 rats at 15 months of age, maintained them for 3 months with implanted corticosterone (CORT) pellets producing low or intermediate (glucocorticoid receptor-activating) blood levels of CORT, and performed microarray/pathway analyses in hippocampal CA1. We defined the chronic GC-dependent transcriptome as 393 genes that exhibited differential expression between intermediate and low CORT groups. Short-term CORT (4 days) did not recapitulate this transcriptome. Functional processes/pathways overrepresented by chronic CORT-up-regulated genes included learning/plasticity, differentiation, glucose metabolism, and cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas processes overrepresented by CORT-down-regulated genes included inflammatory/immune/glial responses and extracellular structure. These profiles indicate that GCs chronically activate neuronal/metabolic processes while coordinately repressing a glial axis of reactivity/inflammation. We then compared the GC transcriptome with a previously defined hippocampal aging transcriptome, revealing a high proportion of common genes. Although CORT and aging moved expression of some common genes in the same direction, the majority were shifted in opposite directions by CORT and aging (eg, glial inflammatory genes down-regulated by CORT are up-regulated with aging). These results contradict the hypothesis that GCs simply promote brain aging and also suggest that the opposite direction shifts during aging reflect resistance to CORT regulation. Therefore, we propose a new model in which aging-related GC resistance develops in some target pathways, whereas GC overstimulation develops in others, together generating much of the brain aging phenotype.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones regulate skeletal development, acquisition of peak bone mass and adult bone maintenance. Abnormal thyroid status during childhood disrupts bone maturation and linear growth, while in adulthood it results in altered bone remodeling and an increased risk of fracture SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review considers the cellular effects and molecular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action in the skeleton. Human clinical and population data are discussed in relation to the skeletal phenotypes of a series of genetically modified mouse models of disrupted thyroid hormone signaling. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Euthyroid status is essential for normal bone development and maintenance. Major thyroid hormone actions in skeletal cells are mediated by thyroid hormone receptor $\alpha$ (TR$\alpha$) and result in anabolic responses during growth and development but catabolic effects in adulthood. These homeostatic responses to thyroid hormone are locally regulated in individual skeletal cell types by the relative activities of the type 2 and 3 iodothyronine deiodinases, which control the supply of the active thyroid hormone 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T3) to its receptor. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Population studies indicate that both thyroid hormone deficiency and excess are associated with an increased risk of fracture. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of T3 action in skeletal cells will lead to the identification of new targets to regulate bone turnover and mineralization in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

abstract = {Sequence-specific interaction between steroid hormone receptors (R) and DNA hormone-responsive elements (HRE) takes place in vitro irrespective of the presence of hormone and even when R is liganded with an antagonist. In vivo, in contrast, the presence of hormone is mandatory for glucocorticosteroid (G) receptor-HRE interaction to occur and no HRE occupancy is detected in the presence of an antagonist. One possible explanation is that in vivo R is originally complexed with a protein that prevents its binding to target HREs. The hormone would then induce the dissociation of the oligomer, thus unmasking the functional DNA binding domain of the receptor. The unliganded, non DNA-binding 8S-form of the chick GR is a hetero-oligomer including the relative molecular mass (Mr) 94,000 steroid-binding unit (4S-GR), and the non-steroid-binding, non-DNA-binding 90,000 protein common to all classes of 8S-R and identified as heat-shock protein (hsp 90). We report here that triamcinolone acetonide (TA) promotes the transformation of 8S-GR to 4S-GR complexes both in explants and in cell-free conditions and that the high-affinity antiglucocorticosteroid RU 486 stabilizes the 8S-GR, as assessed by gradient sedimentation and HPLC. However, in vitro TA- and RU 486- 4S-GR showed comparable DNA-binding activity. These results suggest that the lack of affinity for DNA of the 8S form of GR may be attributable in vivo to the interaction of the 4S-GR protein with hsp 90, and that hormone binding might trigger a conformational change which results in the release of active 4S-GR.},

@article{Delange1994,
abstract = {This paper reviews present knowledge on the etiology, pathophysiology, complications, prevention, and therapy of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency. The recommended dietary allowances of iodine are 100 micrograms/day for adults and adolescents, 60-100 micrograms/day for children aged 1 to 10 years, and 35-40 micrograms/day in infants aged less than 1 year. When the physiological requirements of iodine are not met in a given population, a series of functional and developmental abnormalities occur including thyroid function abnormalities and, when iodine deficiency is severe, endemic goiter and cretinism, endemic mental retardation, decreased fertility rate, increased perinatal death, and infant mortality. These complications, which constitute a hindrance to the development of the affected populations, are grouped under the general heading of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). At least one billion people are at risk of IDD. Iodine deficiency, therefore, constitutes one of the most common preventable causes of mental deficiency in the world today. Most of the affected populations live in mountainous areas in preindustrialized countries, but 50 to 100 million people are still at risk in Europe. The most important target groups to the effects of iodine deficiency from a public health point of view are pregnant mothers, fetuses, neonates, and young infants because the main complication of IDD, i.e., brain damage resulting in irreversible mental retardation, is the consequence of thyroid failure occurring during pregnancy, fetal, and early postnatal life. The main cause of endemic goiter and cretinism is an insufficient dietary supply of iodine. The additional role of naturally occurring goitrogens has been documented in the case of certain foods (milk, cassava, millet, nuts) and bacterial and chemical water pollutants. The mechanism by which the thyroid gland adapts to an insufficient iodine supply is to increase the trapping of iodide as well as the subsequent steps of the intrathyroidal metabolism of iodine leading to preferential synthesis and secretion of triiodotyronine (T3). They are triggered and maintained by increased secretion of TSH, which is ultimately responsible for the development of goiter. The acceleration of the main steps of iodine kinetics and the degree of hyperstimulation by TSH are much more marked in the pediatric age groups, including neonates, than in adults, and the development of goiter appears as an unfavorable side effect in the process of adaptation to iodine deficiency during growth. The most serious complication of iodine deficiency is endemic cretinism, a syndrome characterized by irreversible mental retardation together with either a predominant neurological syndrome or predominant hypothyroidism, or a combination of both syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Cellular actions of thyroid hormone may be initiated within the cell nucleus, at the plasma membrane, in cytoplasm, and at the mitochondrion. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) mediate the biological activities of T(3) via transcriptional regulation. Two TR genes, alpha and beta, encode four T(3)-binding receptor isoforms (alpha1, beta1, beta2, and beta3). The transcriptional activity of TRs is regulated at multiple levels. Besides being regulated by T(3), transcriptional activity is regulated by the type of thyroid hormone response elements located on the promoters of T(3) target genes, by the developmental- and tissue-dependent expression of TR isoforms, and by a host of nuclear coregulatory proteins. These nuclear coregulatory proteins modulate the transcription activity of TRs in a T(3)-dependent manner. In the absence of T(3), corepressors act to repress the basal transcriptional activity, whereas in the presence of T(3), coactivators function to activate transcription. The critical role of TRs is evident in that mutations of the TRbeta gene cause resistance to thyroid hormones to exhibit an array of symptoms due to decreasing the sensitivity of target tissues to T(3). Genetically engineered knockin mouse models also reveal that mutations of the TRs could lead to other abnormalities beyond resistance to thyroid hormones, including thyroid cancer, pituitary tumors, dwarfism, and metabolic abnormalities. Thus, the deleterious effects of mutations of TRs are more severe than previously envisioned. These genetic-engineered mouse models provide valuable tools to ascertain further the molecular actions of unliganded TRs in vivo that could underlie the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism. Actions of thyroid hormone that are not initiated by liganding of the hormone to intranuclear TR are termed nongenomic. They may begin at the plasma membrane or in cytoplasm. Plasma membrane-initiated actions begin at a receptor on integrin alphavbeta3 that activates ERK1/2 and culminate in local membrane actions on ion transport systems, such as the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, or complex cellular events such as cell proliferation. Concentration of the integrin on cells of the vasculature and on tumor cells explains recently described proangiogenic effects of iodothyronines and proliferative actions of thyroid hormone on certain cancer cells, including gliomas. Thus, hormonal events that begin nongenomically result in effects in DNA-dependent effects. l-T(4) is an agonist at the plasma membrane without conversion to T(3). Tetraiodothyroacetic acid is a T(4) analog that inhibits the actions of T(4) and T(3) at the integrin, including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. T(3) can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by a mechanism that may be cytoplasmic in origin or may begin at integrin alphavbeta3. Downstream consequences of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation by T(3) include specific gene transcription and insertion of Na, K-ATPase in the plasma membrane and modulation of the activity of the ATPase. Thyroid hormone, chiefly T(3) and diiodothyronine, has important effects on mitochondrial energetics and on the cytoskeleton. Modulation by the hormone of the basal proton leak in mitochondria accounts for heat production caused by iodothyronines and a substantial component of cellular oxygen consumption. Thyroid hormone also acts on the mitochondrial genome via imported isoforms of nuclear TRs to affect several mitochondrial transcription factors. Regulation of actin polymerization by T(4) and rT(3), but not T(3), is critical to cell migration. This effect has been prominently demonstrated in neurons and glial cells and is important to brain development. The actin-related effects in neurons include fostering neurite outgrowth. A truncated TRalpha1 isoform that resides in the extranuclear compartment mediates the action of thyroid hormone on the cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Changes in adrenal hormones during the complete developmental cycle from egg to juvenile were investigated in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Whole-body concentrations of the adrenal steroids corticosterone (B), and aldosterone (Aldo) were determined by radioimmunoassay and those of the adrenal catecholamines epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (D) were determined by HPLC. In addition, the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase were immunocytochemically localized for the characterization of chromaffin adrenal cells. B and Aldo were not detectable in the whole body before hatching. B levels rose earlier than Aldo levels from stage 36 onward. B had already peaked at stage 46, whereas the largest amounts of Aldo were found at stage 54. After peaking, both steroids decreased gradually to 2.7 +/- 0.62 (B) and 0.4 +/- 0.1 (Aldo) ng/g body wt (mean +/- SEM, n = 10) in juvenile animals. E, NE, and D were detected just after hatching, when E and D showed an early peak at stage 40. E and NE increased moderately during development and demonstrated a sharp increase at the end of metamorphosis from stages 62 onward to 14.4 +/- 1.7 (E) and 34.1 +/- 4.67 (NE) ng/g body wt (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). Interestingly, D levels had a distinct pattern, because concentrations of D remained lower than those of NE and E over nearly the complete development, but showed a dramatic rise during the latest stages, reaching 707 +/- 54 ng/g body wt in juveniles. This dramatic shift in catecholamine levels was confirmed by immunocytochemistry in parallel. A large increase in chromaffin cells labeled with tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity occurred in the latest developmental stages. The catabolic rates for all catecholamines in vivo were similar, which indicates that the different levels are due to various rates of synthesis. Thus, adrenal corticosteroids as well as catecholamines may have regulatory effects during premetamorphosis and metamorphic climax.},

abstract = {Brain development is critically dependent on thyroid hormone (T(3)). Kr\"{u}ppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) is a T(3)-inducible gene in developing rat brain, and several lines of evidence support that KLF9 plays a key role in neuronal morphogenesis. Here we extend our findings to the mouse and demonstrate the presence of a functional T(3) response element (T(3)RE) in the 5' flanking region of the mouse Klf9 gene. Klf9 mRNA is strongly induced in the mouse hippocampus and cerebellum in a developmental stage- and T(3)-dependent manner. Computer analysis identified a near optimal direct repeat 4 (DR-4) T(3)RE 3.8 kb upstream of the Klf9 transcription start site, and EMSAs showed that T(3) receptor (TR)-retinoid X receptor heterodimers bound to the T(3)RE with high affinity. The T(3)RE acts as a strong positive response element in transfection assays using a minimal heterologous promoter. In the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a[TRbeta1], T(3) caused a dose-dependent up-regulation of Klf9 mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays conducted with N2a[TRbeta1] cells showed that TRs associated with the Klf9 T(3)RE, and this association was promoted by T(3). Treatment of N2a[TRbeta1] cells with T(3) led to hyperacetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the T(3)RE site. Furthermore, TRs associated with the DR-4 T(3)RE in postnatal d 4 mouse brain, and histone 4 acetylation was greater at this site compared with other regions of the Klf9 gene. Our study identifies a functional DR-4 T(3)RE located in the mouse Klf9 gene to explain its regulation by T(3) during mammalian brain development.},

abstract = {3,3'5,5'-Tetraiodothyronine (T4), but not 3,3'5-triiodothyronine (T3), acutely regulates the activity of the plasma membrane-bound enzyme, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II), by inducing internalization of the enzyme through an extranuclear, energy-dependent mechanism that requires an intact actin cytoskeleton. The affinity label, N-bromoacetyl-L-T4, binds to 5'D-II and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme but does not initiate internalization. To determine the structural elements of T4 which are required for enzyme internalization, T4 analogs were modified in the alanine side chain and were then evaluated for their ability to induce enzyme internalization, to inhibit enzyme activity, and to promote actin polymerization in hypothyroid cells. The analogs studied showed marked variability in their ability to inactivate 5'D-II. The rank order of potency for enzyme inactivation was T4 > COOH-blocked analogs > NH3 and COOH blocked analogs > NH3 blocked analogs (EC50 values range from 1 to > 1000 nM). In contrast, all T4 analogs tested and T4 were excellent competitive inhibitors of 5'D-II with respect to substrate (Ki values ranged from 4 to 27 nM). The differential capability of iodothyronines to inactivate the enzyme was not related to their ability to enter the cell, since Ki values measured in intact glial cells were equivalent to those measured in cell sonicates. The power of the T4 analogs to inactivate 5'D-II was paralleled by their ability to polymerize actin in hypothyroid cells and to induce 5'D-II binding to F-actin. The data show that modification of the alanine side chain markedly alters the ability of T4 analogs to induce 5'D-II inactivation and actin polymerization. A net negative charge on the alanine side chain of T4 is detrimental for the hormone-dependent inactivation of 5'D-II and polymerization of actin, whereas uncharged or positively charged molecules retain significant activity.},

Here we report that the transcriptional activity of RAR and RXR can be reciprocally modulated by direct interactions between the two proteins. RAR and RXR have a high degree of cooperativity in binding to target DNA, consistent with previous reports indicating that the binding of either RAR or RXR to their cognate response elements is enhanced by factors present in nuclear extracts. RXR also interacts directly with and enhances the binding of nuclear receptors conferring responsiveness to vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone T3; the DNA-binding activities of these receptors are also stimulated by the presence of nuclear extracts. Together these data indicate that RXR has a central role in multiple hormonal signalling pathways.},

@article{Sapolsky2000,
abstract = {The secretion of glucocorticoids (GCs) is a classic endocrine response to stress. Despite that, it remains controversial as to what purpose GCs serve at such times. One view, stretching back to the time of Hans Selye, posits that GCs help mediate the ongoing or pending stress response, either via basal levels of GCs permitting other facets of the stress response to emerge efficaciously, and/or by stress levels of GCs actively stimulating the stress response. In contrast, a revisionist viewpoint posits that GCs suppress the stress response, preventing it from being pathologically overactivated. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding GC action and, based on them, generate criteria for determining whether a particular GC action permits, stimulates, or suppresses an ongoing stress-response or, as an additional category, is preparative for a subsequent stressor. We apply these GC actions to the realms of cardiovascular function, fluid volume and hemorrhage, immunity and inflammation, metabolism, neurobiology, and reproductive physiology. We find that GC actions fall into markedly different categories, depending on the physiological endpoint in question, with evidence for mediating effects in some cases, and suppressive or preparative in others. We then attempt to assimilate these heterogeneous GC actions into a physiological whole.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids, hormones produced by the adrenal gland cortex, perform numerous functions in body homeostasis and the response of the organism to external stressors. One striking feature of their regulation is a diurnal release pattern, with peak levels linked to the start of the activity phase. This release is under control of the circadian clock, an endogenous biological timekeeper that acts to prepare the organism for daily changes in its environment. Circadian control of glucocorticoid production and secretion involves a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as a circadian clock in the adrenal gland itself. Central circadian regulation is mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system, while the adrenal gland clock appears to control sensitivity of the gland to the adrenocorticopic hormone (ACTH). The rhythmically released glucocorticoids in turn might contribute to synchronisation of the cell-autonomous clocks in the body and interact with them to time physiological dynamics in their target tissues around the day.},

abstract = {Despite substantial information on the role of the pituitary-thyroid and pituitary-interrenal axes in controlling amphibian metamorphosis, the hypothalamic hormones responsible for controlling the activity of these axes have not been identified. The mammalian thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) does not regulate the thyroid axis of tadpoles; however, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates the release of thyrotropin from bullfrog tadpole pituitary glands in vitro and may thus function as a central regulator of the thyroid axis during metamorphosis. I tested the possibility that a CRH-like peptide is involved in controlling amphibian development by treating tadpoles of two anuran species, the western spadefoot toad Scaphiopus hammondii, and the North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, with neuropeptides and monitoring their effects on metamorphosis. Injection of spadefoot toad tadpoles with ovine (o) CRH (2 micrograms/animal every other day for 3 weeks) or the amphibian CRH-like peptide sauvagine (SV) significantly decreased their time from hatching to metamorphic climax (Gosner stage 42; frontlimb emergence) and their body weight and body length at climax compared with vehicle-injected controls; whereas, TRH had no effect and arginine vasotocin produced a small but significant lengthening of the larval period but did not alter body size at climax. In an acute response experiment, S. hammondii tadpoles (in Gosner stages 36-38--late prometamorphosis) treated with oCRH or SV (2 micrograms/animal) exhibited significantly elevated whole-body thyroxine (T4) content at 2 and 6 hr after injection; whereas, treatment with TRH (2 micrograms/animal) did not significantly alter whole-body T4. R. catesbeiana tadpoles treated with oCRH or SV (surgical implantation of ELVAX pellets impregnated with 100 micrograms peptide and injections of peptides at 5 micrograms/animal once every 3 days) exhibited accelerated spontaneous and triiodothyronine (T3)-induced metamorphosis as assessed by changes in tail height, hind limb development, and body weight; TRH had no effect. Injections of a pool of antisera generated against CRH-like peptides (rat/human CRH, oCRH, SV) slowed T3-induced metamorphosis when compared with normal serum-injected controls. These results support the hypothesis that a CRH-like peptide(s) is involved in the central control of metamorphosis of anuran amphibians, and may act, at least in part, through stimulation of the thyroid axis.},

abstract = {Basal activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis changes over development in larval amphibians, but development of the responsiveness of this axis to an external stressor has not been studied. We compared developmental changes in whole-body corticosterone content of two anuran amphibian species, Rana pipiens (family Ranidae) and Xenopus laevis (family Pipidae). We also examined developmental changes in the responsiveness of the HPI axis by subjecting tadpoles of different developmental stages to a laboratory shaking/confinement stress and to ACTH injection. We measured whole-body corticosterone content as an indicator of the activity of the HPI axis. Whole-body corticosterone content of R. pipiens remained low during premetamorphosis and prometamorphosis but increased dramatically at metamorphic climax and remained elevated in juvenile frogs. By contrast, whole-body corticosterone content of X. laevis was highest during premetamorphosis, declined at the onset of prometamorphosis, increased at metamorphic climax and remained at climax levels in juvenile frogs. Premetamorphic and prometamorphic tadpoles of both species showed strong corticosterone responses to both shaking stress and ACTH injection. The magnitude and pattern of response differed among developmental stages, with premetamorphic tadpoles of both species showing greater responsiveness to stress and ACTH. Our results show that interrenal responsiveness is developed in premetamorphic tadpoles, suggesting that at these stages tadpoles are capable of mounting an increase in stress hormone production in response to changes in the external environment. Our results also highlight the importance of comparative studies in understanding the development of the stress axis.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones (GCHs) regulate normal and neoplastic lymphocyte development by exerting antiproliferative and/or apoptotic effects. We have previously shown that dexamethasone (DEX)-activated thymocyte apoptosis requires a sequence of events including interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and acidic sphingomyelinase (aSMase) activation. We analyzed the mechanisms of GCH-activated apoptosis by focusing on GR-associated Src kinase, cytochrome c release, and caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation. We show here that PI-PLC binds to GR-associated Src kinase, as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, DEX treatment induces PI-PLC phosphorylation and activation. DEX-induced PI-PLC phosphorylation, activation, and apoptosis are inhibited by PP1, a Src kinase inhibitor, thus suggesting that Src-mediated PI-PLC activation is involved in DEX-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9, -8, and -3 activation and cytochrome c release can be detected 1 to 2 hours after DEX treatment. Caspase-9 inhibition does not counter cytochrome c release, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. Caspase-8 inhibition counters cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis, thus suggesting that caspase-8 inhibitor can directly inhibit caspase-9 and/or that DEX-induced caspase-8 activation is upstream to mitochondria and can regulate caspase-3 directly or through cytochrome c release and the consequent caspase-9/caspase-3 activation. DEX-induced caspase-8 activation, like ceramide-induced caspase-8 activation, correlates with the formation of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)/caspase-8 complex. Caspase-8 activation is countered by the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and of Src kinase, PI-PLC, and aSMase activation, suggesting it is downstream in the DEX-activated apoptotic pathway of thymocytes.},

abstract = {Extranuclear or nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone do not require formation of a nuclear complex between the hormone and its traditional 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) receptor (TR). Among nongenomic actions of iodothyronines that are relevant to the heart are those on membrane ion channels or pumps. These include stimulation of the sarcolemmal Na+ channel, inward-rectifying K+ channel, voltage-activated potassium channels, and calcium pump (Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatases [ATPases]) and have been shown in intact cells or isolated membranes. Because circulating levels of thyroid hormone are relatively stable, actions on channels or pumps may contribute to setting of basal activity of these transport functions. The mechanism of certain of these membrane effects may involve actions of the hormone on signal transducing protein kinases that modulate levels of activity of plasma membrane channels. Thyroid hormone nongenomically enhances myocardial contractility in isolated myocardial cells, in the isolated perfused rat heart and in human subjects. Iodothyronines also decrease vasomotor tone in a variety of models and in man by a mechanism independent of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), or nitric oxide generation. Acutely increased myocardial mitochondrial respiration has been demonstrated in isolated organelles exposed to thyroid hormone. Genomic and nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone can interface, e.g., at the level of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, where gene expression is regulated by the TR-T3 complex and activity of the enzyme can be modulated nongenomically. The relevance of nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone on the heart has been demonstrated in acute effects of the hormone on cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance in human subjects.},

Herein, we report altered MFG-E8 expression in inflamed colons during the acute phase of murine experimental colitis and found that treatment with recombinant MFG-E8, but not its arginine-glycine-aspartate mutant counterpart, ameliorated colitis by reducing inflammation and improving disease parameters. To reveal the MFG-E8-mediated antiinflammatory mechanism, we employed an in vitro system, which showed the down-regulation of NF-kappaB in an LPS-dependent manner. Additionally, MFG-E8 altered alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-mediated focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation by impeding the binding of one of its potent ligands osteopontin, which becomes activated during colitis. Taken together, our results indicated that MFG-E8 has a novel therapeutic potential for treatment of colitis.},

abstract = {Previous investigations have shown that culture of freshly isolated hepatocytes under conventional conditions, i.e., on dried rat tail collagen in the presence of growth factors, facilitates cell growth but also causes an extensive down-regulation of most liver-specific functions. This dedifferentiation process can be prevented if the cells are cultured on a reconstituted basement membrane gel matrix derived from the Englebreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma tumor (EHS gel). To gain insight into the mechanisms regulating this response to extracellular matrix, we are analyzing the activities of two families of transcription factors, C/EBP and AP-1, which control the transcription of hepatic and growth-responsive genes, respectively. We demonstrate that isolation of hepatocytes from the normal quiescent rat liver by collagenase perfusion activates the immediate-early growth response program, as indicated by increased expression of c-jun, junB, c-fos, and c-myc mRNAs. Adhesion of these activated cells to dried rat tail collagen augments the elevated levels of these mRNAs for the initial 1 to 2 h postplating; junB and c-myc mRNA levels then drop steeply, with junB returning to normal quiescence and the c-myc level remaining slightly elevated during the 3-day culture period. Levels of c-jun mRNA and AP-1 DNA binding activity, however, remain elevated from the outset, while C/EBP alpha mRNA expression is down-regulated, resulting in a decrease in the steady-state levels of the 42- and 30-kDa C/EBP alpha polypeptides and C/EBP alpha DNA binding activity. In contrast, C/EBP beta mRNA production remains at near-normal hepatic levels for 5 to 8 days of culture, although its DNA binding activity decreases severalfold during this time. Adhesion of hepatocytes to the EHS gel for the same period of time dramatically alters this program: it arrests growth and inhibits AP-1 DNA binding activity and the expression of c-jun, junB, and c-myc mRNAs, but, in addition, it restores C/EBP alpha mRNA and protein as well as C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta DNA binding activities to the abundant levels present in freshly isolated hepatocytes. These changes are not due merely to growth inhibition, because suppression of hepatocyte proliferation on collagen by epidermal growth factor starvation or addition of transforming growth factor beta does not inhibit AP-1 activity or restore C/EBP alpha DNA binding activity to normal hepatic levels. These data suggest that expression of the normal hepatic phenotype requires that hepatocytes exist in a G0 state of growth arrest, facilitated here by adhesion of cells to the EHS gel, in order to express high levels of hepatic transcription factors such as C/EBP alpha.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones are necessary for life and are essential in all aspects of human health and disease. The actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which binds glucocorticoid hormones and regulates gene expression, cell signaling, and homeostasis. Decades of research have focused on the mechanisms of action of one isoform of GR, GRa. However, in recent years, increasing numbers of human GR (hGR) isoforms have been reported. Evidence obtained from this and other laboratories indicates that multiple hGR isoforms are generated from one single hGR gene via mutations and/or polymorphisms, transcript alternative splicing, and alternative translation initiation. Each hGR protein, in turn, is subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications, and the nature and degree of posttranslational modification affect receptor function. We summarize here the processes that generate and modify various hGR isoforms with a focus on those that impact the ability of hGR to regulate target genes. We speculate that unique receptor compositions and relative receptor proportions within a cell determine the specific response to glucocorticoids. Unchecked expression of some isoforms, for example hGRbeta, has been implicated in various diseases.},

With the use of MR-GR chimeras, a segment of the NH2-terminal region of GR (amino acids 105 to 440) was shown to be required for this repression.

abstract = {A number of transcription factor proteins contain domains that are fully or partially unstructured. The means by which such proteins acquire naturally folded conformations are not well understood. When they encounter their proper binding partner(s), several of these proteins adopt a folded conformation through an induced-fit mechanism. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Expressed independently as a recombinant peptide, the N-terminal transactivation domain (AF1) of the GR shows little structure and appears to exist as a collection of random coil configurations. The GR AF1 is known to interact with other transcription factors, including a critical component of the general transcription machinery proteins, the TATA box binding protein (TBP). We tested whether this interaction can lead to acquisition of structure in the GR AF1. Our results show that recombinant GR AF1 acquires a significant amount of helical content when it interacts with TBP. These structural changes were monitored by Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies, and by proteolytic digestions. Our results support a model in which TBP binding interaction with the GR AF1 induces significantly greater helical structure in the AF1 domain. This increased helical content in the GR AF1 appears to come mostly at the expense of random coil conformation. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that an induced-fit mechanism gives structure to the GR AF1 when it encounters TBP.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the influence of in vivo treatment and in vitro addition of thyroid hormone on in organello mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and, in parallel, on the in organello footprinting patterns at the mtDNA regions involved in the regulation of transcription. We found that thyroid hormone modulates mitochondrial RNA levels and the mRNA/rRNA ratio by influencing the transcriptional rate. In addition, we found conspicuous differences between the mtDNA dimethyl sulfate footprinting patterns of mitochondria derived from euthyroid and hypothyroid rats at the transcription initiation sites but not at the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) binding region. Furthermore, direct addition of thyroid hormone to the incubation medium of mitochondria isolated from hypothyroid rats restored the mRNA/rRNA ratio found in euthyroid rats as well as the mtDNA footprinting patterns at the transcription initiation area. Therefore, we conclude that the regulatory effect of thyroid hormone on mitochondrial transcription is partially exerted by a direct influence of the hormone on the mitochondrial transcription machinery. Particularly, the influence on the mRNA/rRNA ratio is achieved by selective modulation of the alternative H-strand transcription initiation sites and does not require the previous activation of nuclear genes. These results provide the first functional demonstration that regulatory signals, such as thyroid hormone, that modify the expression of nuclear genes can also act as primary signals for the transcriptional apparatus of mitochondria.},

abstract = {Kr\"{u}ppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a thyroid hormone-induced, immediate early gene implicated in neural development in vertebrates. We analyzed stressor and glucocorticoid (GC)-dependent regulation of KLF9 expression in the brain of the frog Xenopus laevis, and investigated a possible role for KLF9 in neuronal differentiation. Exposure to shaking/confinement stressor increased plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentration, and KLF9 immunoreactivity in several brain regions, which included the medial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior preoptic area (homologous to the mammalian paraventricular nucleus), and optic tectum (homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus). The stressor-induced KLF9 mRNA expression in the brain was blocked by pretreatment with the GC receptor antagonist RU486, or mimicked by injection of CORT. Treatment with CORT also caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in KLF9 mRNA in X. laevis XTC-2 cells that was resistant to inhibition of protein synthesis. The action of CORT on KLF9 expression in XTC-2 cells was blocked by RU486, but not by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. To test for functional consequences of up-regulation of KLF9, we introduced a KLF9 expression plasmid into living tadpole brain by electroporation-mediated gene transfer. Forced expression of KLF9 in tadpole brain caused an increase in Golgi-stained cells, reflective of neuronal differentiation/maturation. Our results support that KLF9 is a direct, GC receptor target gene that is induced by stress, and functions as an intermediary in the actions of GCs on brain gene expression and neuronal structure.},

GenAge is a curated database of genes related to human ageing. Entries were primarily selected based on genetic perturbations in animal models and human diseases as well as an extensive literature review. Each entry includes a variety of automated and manually curated information, including, where available, protein-protein interactions, the relevant literature, and a description of the gene and how it relates to human ageing. The goal of GenAge is to provide the most complete and comprehensive database of genes related to human ageing on the Internet as well as render an overview of the genetics of human ageing. AnAge is an integrative database describing the ageing process in several organisms and featuring, if available, maximum life span, taxonomy, developmental schedules and metabolic rate, making AnAge a unique resource for the comparative biology of ageing. Associated with the databases are data-mining tools and software designed to investigate the role of genes and proteins in the human ageing process as well as analyse ageing across different taxa.

abstract = {By analogy with steroid receptors, human placental thyroid hormone nuclear receptor (hTR beta 1) could be divided into four functional domains: A/B (Met1-Leu101), C (Cys102-Ala170), D (Thr171-Lys237), and E (Arg238-Asp456). The E domain was thought to bind thyroid hormone. To evaluate whether domain E alone is sufficient to bind T3 or requires the presence of other domains for functional T3-binding activity, a series of deletion mutants was constructed. The mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the expressed proteins were purified. Analysis of the T3-binding affinity and analog specificity of the purified truncated hTR beta 1 indicated that domain E alone did not have T3-binding activity. Extension of the amino-terminal sequence of domain E to include part of domain D yielded a mutant (Lys201-Asp456) with a Ka for T3 of 0.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) M-1. Further extension to include the entire domain D (Met169-Asp456) yielded a mutant with T3-binding activity with a Ka of 0.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(9) M-1. Further extension of the amino-terminal sequence to include domain C increased the affinity for T3 by nearly 2-fold (Ka = 1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) M-1). The Ka for the wild-type hTR beta 1 is 1.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) M-1. Furthermore, mutant (Met169-Asp456) binds to 3',5',3-triiodo-L-thyropropionic acid, D-T3, L-T4, and L-T3 with 307\%, 37\%, 7\%, and 0.1\%, respectively, of the activity of L-T3. This order of analog affinity is similar to that of the wild-type hTR beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Within a response element, the precise sequence to which the receptor binds has been implicated in directing its structure and activity. Here, we use NMR chemical-shift difference mapping to show that nonspecific interactions with bases at particular positions in the binding sequence, such as those of the 'spacer', affect the conformation of distinct regions of the rat GR DNA-binding domain. These regions include the DNA-binding surface, the 'lever arm' and the dimerization interface, suggesting an allosteric pathway that signals between the DNA-binding sequence and the associated dimer partner. Disrupting this pathway by mutating the dimer interface alters sequence-specific conformations, DNA-binding kinetics and transcriptional activity. Our study demonstrates that GR dimer partners collaborate to read DNA shape and to direct sequence-specific gene activity.},

abstract = {Hormones play critical roles in vertebrate development, and frog metamorphosis has been an excellent model system to study the developmental roles of thyroid hormone (TH) and glucocorticoids. Whereas TH regulates the initiation and rate of metamorphosis, the actions of corticosterone (CORT; the main glucocorticoid in frogs) are more complex. In the absence of TH during premetamorphosis, CORT inhibits development, but in the presence of TH during metamorphosis, CORT synergizes with TH to accelerate development. Synergy at the level of gene expression is known for three genes in frogs, but the nature and extent of TH and CORT cross talk is otherwise unknown. Therefore, to examine TH and CORT interactions, we performed microarray analysis on tails from Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles treated with CORT, TH, CORT+TH, or vehicle for 18 h. The expression of 5432 genes was significantly altered in response to either or both hormones. Using Venn diagrams and cluster analysis, we identified 16 main patterns of gene regulation due to up- or down-regulation by TH and/or CORT. Many genes were affected by only one of the hormones, and a large proportion of regulated genes (22\%) required both hormones. We also identified patterns of additive or synergistic, inhibitory, subtractive, and annihilatory regulation. A total of 928 genes (17\%) were regulated by novel interactions between the two hormones. These data expand our understanding of the hormonal cross talk underlying the gene regulation cascade directing tail resorption and suggest the possibility that CORT affects not only the timing but also the nature of TH-dependent tissue transformation.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Circadian control of physiology is mediated by local, tissue-based clocks, synchronized to each other and to solar time by signals from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master oscillator in the hypothalamus. These local clocks coordinate the transcription of key pathways to establish tissue-specific daily metabolic programs. How local transcriptomes are synchronized across the organism and their relative contribution to circadian output remain unclear. In the present study we showed that glucocorticoids alone are able to synchronize expression of about 60\% of the circadian transcriptome. We propose that synchronization occurs directly by the action of glucocorticoids on a diverse range of downstream targets and indirectly by regulating the core clock genes mPer1, Bmal1, mCry1, and Dbp. We have identified the pivotal liver transcription factor, HNF4alpha, as a mediator of circadian and glucocorticoid-regulated transcription, showing that it is a key conduit for downstream targeting. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that by orchestrating transcriptional cascades, glucocorticoids are able to direct synchronization of a diverse range of functionally important circadian genes.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoids, cortisol and corticosterone, have a unique function in the fetus in inducing a wide range of enzymes before birth that have little or no function during fetal life but on which survival after birth is dependent. The loss of the placenta at birth deprives the fetus of a source of oxygen, glucose and heat (among many other things) for which alternatives must be available immediately if survival is to be assured. In anticipation of these needs several organs undergo maturational changes in late pregnancy aimed at meeting these requirements. The lungs mature structurally and functionally, becoming distensible and capable of coping with high surface tension when air enters the alveoli with the first breath. In the liver, glycogen accumulates and gluconeogenesis is initiated to meet the demands for glucose until feeding begins. There is an increase in the production of tri-iodothyronine and catecholamines in preparation for the sharp increase in metabolic rate and thermogenesis associated with breathing and the cold environment. All these dramatic maturational events are regulated by cortisol as are numerous others in most organ systems that contribute to neonatal well-being but on which survival is less dependent. Pharmacological manipulation of these systems before birth has made a substantial contribution to improving human health.},

Here, we used a long-term data set from a population of mountain white-crowned sparrows to estimate natural selection on glucocorticoid profiles. Our study suggests that survival selection favours higher hormone concentrations for multiple components of glucocorticoid physiology (both baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoid levels). Fecundity selection varies depending on the component of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal physiology; greater reproductive output was associated with higher baseline glucocorticoid levels, but lower stress-induced glucocorticoid levels. Additionally, the selection gradient was greater for glucocorticoids than for a morphological trait (wing length). These results support the hypothesis that stress-induced glucocorticoids increase survival over reproduction within a wild population (the CORT-trade-off hypothesis). Taken together, these results add to our knowledge of how selection operates on physiological traits and also provide an evolutionary and ecological perspective on several key open issues in the field of glucocorticoid physiology.},

abstract = {The biosynthesis of steroid hormones requires the coordinated expression of the enzymes that comprise the pathways via which specific hormones are synthesized. These pathways and their associated enzymes are typically subject to regulation consisting of trophic hormone stimuli and feedback mechanisms. Very few tissues contribute substantially to de novo steroidogenesis, primarily the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the placenta. Both the embryonic origins and the signaling mechanisms for the adrenals and gonads are similar, and steroid synthesis in these two glands are the major focus of this review. We will further describe peripheral steroid metabolism and the regulation of steroid hormone potency in target tissues. In addition, we will briefly discuss the congenital adrenal hyperplasias to illustrate the principles developed in the initial sections. Finally, we will discuss some recent developments in steroidogensis, focusing on cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and the alternate or "backdoor" pathway to dihydrotestosterone. We will conclude with a description of aberrant signaling mechanisms observed in adrenal tumors as a further example of how these pathways can be disturbed in pathologic states.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In epidemiological studies, adverse early-life conditions associate with subsequent cardiometabolic disease. Hypothesized causes include maternal malnutrition, foetal glucocorticoid overexposure and reduced growth factors. Animal studies suggest a role for epigenetic processes in maintaining early-life effects into adulthood, but human relevance is unknown. We aimed to investigate relationships between an unbalanced maternal diet in pregnancy, neonatal and adult anthropometric variables with methylation at key genes controlling tissue glucocorticoid action and foetal growth.

DESIGN: We studied 34 individuals aged 40 from the Motherwell cohort study whose mothers ate an unbalanced diet in pregnancy, previously linked with elevated blood pressure and cortisol in adult offspring.

MEASUREMENTS: DNA methylation at 11$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was measured by pyrosequencing on buffy coat DNA.

RESULTS: Methylation at specific CpGs in the HSD2 promoter and at one of the IGF2 differentially methylated regions (H19 ICR) correlated with neonatal anthropometric variables. CpG methylation within HSD2, GR and H19 ICR was positively associated with increased adiposity and blood pressure in adulthood. Methylation at GR (exon 1F) was increased in offspring of mothers with the most unbalanced diets in pregnancy.

CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in DNA methylation at genes important in regulating circulating cortisol levels, tissue glucocorticoid action, blood pressure and foetal growth are present in adulthood in association with both early-life parameters and cardiometabolic risk factors. The data indicate a persisting epigenetic link between early-life maternal diet and/or foetal growth and cardiovascular disease risk in humans.},

We report here that one single GR mRNA species unexpectedly produces at least eight functional GR N-terminal isoforms via translational mechanisms. These GR isoforms display diverse cytoplasm-to-nucleus trafficking patterns and distinct transcriptional activities. In human osteosarcoma cells, the transcriptional responses to glucocorticoids closely reflect the identity and abundance of the GR isoforms. In addition, each GR isoform regulates both a common and a unique set of genes in the same cell. Interestingly, the levels of these GR isoforms differ significantly among tissues. Based on these observations, we propose that cell-type specific GR isoforms generate specificity in glucocorticoid control of transcription in different tissues.},

DNA-dependent dimerization contacts mediated between the receptor DNA binding domains stabilize DNA binding. Additionally, some steroid receptors dimerize prior to their arrival on DNA through interactions mediated through the receptor ligand binding domain. In this report, we describe the steroid-induced homomeric interaction of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in solution in vivo. Our results demonstrate that GR interacts in solution at least as a dimer, and we have delimited this interaction to a novel interface within the hinge region of GR that appears to be both necessary and sufficient for direct binding. Strikingly, we also demonstrate an interaction between GR and the mineralocorticoid receptor in solution in vivo that is dependent on the ligand binding domain of GR alone and is separable from homodimerization of the glucocorticoid receptor. These results indicate that functional interactions between the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in activating specific gene transcription are probably more complex than has been previously appreciated.},

abstract = {A multiprotein hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery functions as a 'cradle-to-grave' system for regulating the steroid binding, trafficking and turnover of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In an ATP-dependent process where hsp70 and hsp90 act as essential chaperones and Hop, hsp40, and p23 act as nonessential co-chaperones, the machinery assembles complexes between the ligand binding domain of the GR and hsp90. During GR-hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, the hydrophobic ligand-binding cleft is opened to access by steroid, and subsequent binding of steroid within the cleft triggers a transformation of the receptor such that it engages in more dynamic cycles of assembly/disassembly with hsp90 that are required for rapid dynein-dependent translocation to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the hsp90 chaperone machinery plays a critical role both in GR movement to transcription regulatory sites and in the disassembly of regulatory complexes as the hormone level declines. The chaperone machinery also plays a critical role in stabilization of the GR to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The initial GR interaction with hsp70 appears to be critical for the triage between hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and preservation of receptor function vs CHIP-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The hsp90 chaperone machinery is ubiquitous and functionally conserved among eukaryotes, and it is possible that all physiologically significant actions of hsp90 require the hsp70-dependent assembly of client protein-hsp90 heterocomplexes.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones (THs) have pleiotropic effects on vertebrate development, with amphibian metamorphosis as the most spectacular example. However, developmental functions of THs in non-vertebrate chordates are largely hypothetical and even TH endogenous production has been poorly investigated. In order to get better insight into the evolution of the thyroid hormone signaling pathway in chordates, we have taken advantage of the recent release of the amphioxus genome. We found amphioxus homologous sequences to most of the genes encoding proteins involved in thyroid hormone signaling in vertebrates, except the fast-evolving thyroglobulin: sodium iodide symporter, thyroid peroxidase, deiodinases, thyroid hormone receptor, TBG, and CTHBP. As only some genes encoding proteins involved in TH synthesis regulation were retrieved (TRH, TSH receptor, and CRH receptor but not their corresponding receptors and ligands), there may be another mode of upstream regulation of TH synthesis in amphioxus. In accord with the notion that two whole genome duplications took place at the base of the vertebrate tree, one amphioxus gene often corresponded to several vertebrate homologs. However, some amphioxus specific duplications occurred, suggesting that several steps of the TH pathway were independently elaborated in the cephalochordate and vertebrate lineages. The present results therefore indicate that amphioxus is capable of producing THs. As several genes of the TH signaling pathway were also found in the sea urchin genome, we propose that the thyroid hormone signaling pathway is of ancestral origin in chordates, if not in deuterostomes, with specific elaborations in each lineage, including amphioxus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic maternal asthma is associated with reduced growth of the female fetus and normal growth of the male fetus. The mechanisms that control the differential effects of maternal asthma on the fetus have not been fully elucidated but alterations in placental function may play a role. In the current study we have used microarray platform to examine fetal sex-specific global changes in placental gene expression in pregnancies complicated by asthma as compared to non-asthmatic subjects.

METHODS: Placental RNA was extracted from 11 control subjects and 38 asthmatic subjects. Labeled cDNA was hybridized to an oligonucleotide chip with 1700 double spotted well-characterized human genes. Global gene expression data analysis and visualization were performed using the Binary Tree-Structured Vector Quantization (BTSVQ) software. Functional relationships of differentially expressed genes were assessed using protein-protein interaction database I2D, network analysis and visualization software NAViGaTOR and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.

RESULTS: Overall, 65 genes were found to be altered in placentae of pregnancies complicated by asthma. Of these, only 6 genes were altered in male placentae. There were 59 gene changes in female placentae of asthmatic mothers relative to control placentae. Some of the sex-specific genes were associated with growth, inflammation and immune pathways.

CONCLUSION: There are sex-specific alterations in placental gene expression in the presence of maternal asthma. Given that many of the identified genes in the female placentae were associated with or involved in cellular growth and tissue development, these may contribute to the sexually dimorphic difference in fetal growth in response to maternal asthma.},

Here, we show that methylation patterns within populations of cells from individual somatic tissues are heterogeneous and polymorphic. Using in vitro evolution of immortalized fibroblasts for over 300 generations, we track the dynamics of polymorphic methylation at regions developing significant differential methylation on average. The data indicate that changes in population-averaged methylation occur through a stochastic process that generates a stream of local and uncorrelated methylation aberrations. Despite the stochastic nature of the process, nearly deterministic epigenetic remodeling emerges on average at loci that lose or gain resistance to methylation accumulation. Changes in the susceptibility to methylation accumulation are correlated with changes in histone modification and CTCF occupancy. Characterizing epigenomic polymorphism within cell populations is therefore critical to understanding methylation dynamics in normal and cancer cells.},

abstract = {Plasma membrane integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$3 is a cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone at which nongenomic actions are initiated. L-thyroxine (T₄) and 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T₃) promote angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation via the receptor. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a deaminated T₄ derivative, blocks the nongenomic proliferative and proangiogenic actions of T₄ and T₃. Acting at the integrin independently of T₄ and T₃, tetrac and a novel nanoparticulate formulation of tetrac that acts exclusively at the cell surface have oncologically desirable antiproliferative actions on multiple tumor cell survival pathway genes. These agents also block the angiogenic activity of vascular growth factors. Volume and vascular support of xenografts of human pancreatic, kidney, lung, and breast cancers are downregulated by tetrac formulations. The integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$3 receptor site for thyroid hormone selectively regulates signal transduction pathways and distinguishes between unmodified tetrac and the nanoparticulate formulation. The receptor also mediates nongenomic thyroid hormone effects on plasma membrane ion transporters and on intracellular protein trafficking.},

abstract = {Adrenal steroids have been shown to accelerate both spontaneous and thyroid hormone (TH)-induced metamorphosis. The present study is concerned with the mechanisms underlying this effect. Premetamorphic Rana catesbeiana tadpoles were immersed in water containing 1-20 nM T4 or T3 +/- 1 microM corticosterone (B) for 6 to 19 days. B is the predominant glucocorticoid in tadpole plasma before climax. As indicated by the rate of tail resorption and hepatic carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) activity, metamorphosis was significantly accelerated when TH-treated animals also received B: after 14 days in T4 (20 nM), tadpole tail length was decreased by 10\%; in T4 + B, the decrease was 19\%. At the same time, CPS activity was increased approximately 12-fold in tadpoles in T4 and 18-fold in those in T4 + B. Comparable results were obtained when T3 was employed. Neither tail resorption nor CPS activity was influenced by B alone. Plasma T4 levels attained at all bath concentrations of T4 were increased more than 2-fold when B was present. The same was true when T3 was used. In addition, in tadpoles immersed in 20 nM T4, the plasma T3 level-was significantly increased in the presence of B. Assessment of 5'-deiodinase and 5-deiodinase activities in vitro revealed that administration of B for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in 5'-deiodinase activity in skin and a significant reduction in T3 5-deiodinase activity in both liver and gut. Treatment with B reduced the rate of turnover of T3; 72 h after injection of 0.01 nmol [125I]T3, B-treated tadpoles had retained approximately 58\% of the dose vs. 42\% in controls. T3 nuclear receptor number (sites per nucleus) as assessed by an in vitro saturation technique was not altered in liver, tail, or red blood cells after 14 days of exposure to B. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that the acceleration of TH-induced metamorphosis by B is due at least in part to its ability to increase the plasma level of T4 or T3 through its effects on the peripheral metabolism of TH.

abstract = {Glucocorticoids induce tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) synthesis in cultured rat hepatoma cells. These steroids penetrate the cell membrane and bind to specific cytoplasmic receptor proteins. The resulting complex binds to the nucleus. This nuclear binding has now been studied in a cell-free preparation. The reaction appears to require a temperature-dependent modification of the steroid-receptor complex. There is a fixed number of nuclear sites that are half saturated at a complex concentration of 6 to 24 x 10(-11) M. Treatment with deoxyribonuclease destroys nuclear-binding capacity. The complex also binds to purified HTC cell DNA with characteristics similar to the binding to isolated nuclei, and, as in intact cells, receptors complexed with an anti-inducer steroid bind very poorly to DNA. These data suggest that the nuclear sites for binding steroid-receptor complexes are on the DNA. Since the extent of complex binding to purified DNA exceeds that observed with isolated nuclei, chromosomal proteins may act to restrict binding to certain regions of the DNA. These studies suggest that steroid hormones stimulate the synthesis of specific proteins by affecting the transcription of structural or regulatory genes.},

abstract = {In premetamorphic tadpoles precocious metamorphosis can be induced by immersion in water containing either T4 or T3. T3 5-deiodinase (5D) activity is present in most tissues, and T4 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity is present in gut and skin; both systems can be inhibited by iopanoic acid (IOP). If conversion of T4 to T3 is important for the normal physiological action of T4 in these tadpoles, it follows that IOP should decrease the effects of T4 and increase those of T3 on metamorphic events. To test this, tadpoles were immersed in water containing either T4 or T3 (20 nM) with or without 1.75 microM IOP. Two indices of metamorphosis, increased leg length and hepatic carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity, were studied. In vehicle- or IOP-treated animals, change in leg length and carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity were minimal. Both indices were increased after exposure to T3 for 10 days or to T4 for 21 days. Moreover, the effects of T3 were significantly enhanced while those of T4 were inhibited when IOP was also present. Both 5'D and 5D activities determined in vitro were inhibited (95\% and 60\%, respectively) in IOP-treated tadpoles, and this was associated with an increase in the plasma concentration of hormone. In separate experiments, vehicle- and IOP-treated tadpoles received [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 ip. Plasma, liver, gut, and skin were examined 12-24 h later for 125I-labeled products. After [125I]T4 treatment [125I]T3 was found in skin and gut, but not in plasma or liver. After [125I]T3 treatment [125I]3,3'-diiodothyronine was identified in all extracts studied. In vivo generation of these products was reduced by 50\% in IOP-treated tadpoles. These findings indicate that generation of T3 from T4 can take place in vivo in the premetamorphic tadpole and strongly support the hypothesis that this process plays an important role in the physiological action of T4 in this species.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones are involved in developmental and homeostatic processes in several tissues. Their action results in different outcomes depending on the developmental stage, tissue and/or cellular context. Interestingly, their pleiotropic roles are conserved across vertebrates. It is largely documented that thyroid hormones act via nuclear receptors, the TRs, which are transcription factors and whose activity can be modulated by the local availability of the hormone T3. In the "classical view", the T3-induced physiological response depends on the expression of specific TR isoforms and the iodothyronine deiodinase selenoenzymes that control the local level of T3, thus TR activity. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: Recent data have clearly established that the functionality of TRs is coordinated and integrated with other signaling pathways, specifically at the level of stem/progenitor cell populations. Here, we summarize these data and propose a new and intriguing role for thyroid hormones in two selected examples.},

abstract = {Chromatin disruption and transcriptional activation are both thyroid hormone-dependent processes regulated by the heterodimer of thyroid hormone receptor and 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (TR-RXR). In the absence of hormone, TR-RXR binds to nucleosomal DNA, locally disrupts histone-DNA contacts and generates a DNase I-hypersensitive site. Chromatin-bound unliganded TR-RXR silences transcription of the Xenopus TRbetaA gene within a canonical nucleosomal array. On addition of hormone, the receptor directs the extensive further disruption of chromatin structure over several hundred base pairs of DNA and activates transcription. We define a domain of the TR protein necessary for directing this extensive hormone-dependent chromatin disruption. Particular TR-RXR heterodimers containing mutations in this domain are able to bind both hormone and their thyroid hormone receptor recognition element (TRE) within chromatin, yet are unable to direct the extensive hormone-dependent disruption of chromatin or to activate transcription. We distinguish the hormone-dependent disruption of chromatin and transcriptional activation as independently regulated events through the mutagenesis of basal promoter elements and by altering the position and number of TREs within the TRbetaA promoter. Chromatin disruption alone on a minichromosome is shown to be insufficient for transcriptional activation of the TRbetaA gene.},

Furthermore, mutants that cannot heterodimerize do not inhibit each other's activity.

The discovery of these mediators, along with that of macrophage-derived substances that operate at the local wound level, such as platelet-derived, basic fibroblast, transforming, and epidermal growth factors, coupled with advances in molecular biology portends much for the future. The ability to alter the endocrine response with techniques such as epidural anesthesia, the ability to specifically block certain aspects of the response (e.g., with adrenergic and prostaglandin antagonists), and the ability to synthesize potential beneficial mediators with recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., GH) may allow for modulating the response to decrease debility and complications.},

Rat cardiac fibroblasts produce and secrete glucuronidated thyroxine (T4G) and 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3G). We here show that, compared to fibroblasts from other anatomical locations, the capacity of cardiofibroblasts to secrete T4G and T3G is highest. H9c2(2-1) myotubes, a model system for cardiomyocytes, take up T4G and T3G at a rate that is 10-15 times higher than that for the unconjugated thyroid hormones. T3 and T4, and their glucuronides, stimulate H9c2(2-1) myoblast-to-myotube differentiation. A substantial beta-glucuronidase activity was measured in H9c2(2-1) myotubes, and this confers a deconjugating capacity to these cells, via which native thyroid hormones can be regenerated from glucuronidated precursors. This indicates that the stimulatory effects on myoblast differentiation are exerted by the native hormones. We suggest that glucuronidation represents a mechanism to uncouple local thyroid hormone action in the heart from that in other peripheral tissues and in the systemic circulation. This could represent a mechanism for the local fine-tuning of cardiac thyroid hormone action.},

abstract = {Endemic iodine deficiency is associated with maternal hypothyroxinemia and a relatively high incidence of neurological disorders in the offspring. The previous assumption that the placenta is impermeable to maternal thyroid hormone, has resulted in the erroneous suggestion that iodine per se has an essential role in brain development. Furthermore, the observed factorial rise in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) in pregnancy has often been misinterpreted as preventing thyroid hormone loss to either the fetal compartment or excretory systems. However, physiochemical analysis of the role of specific binding proteins in hormone delivery, combined with epidemiological evidence and evolutionary considerations has led us to postulate that a) maternal thyroxine (T4) is transported to the fetus, and is of crucial importance in early fetal development, and b) TBG forms part of a control system specifically designed to maintain at an optimal level the T4 environment to which the developing fetus is exposed. Placental transfer of maternal T4 in a variety of mammalian species (including humans) is now well established. Further experimental studies in rats have shown that perturbation of the intrauterine thyroid hormone environment during critical phases of brain development results in a spectrum of biochemical dysgenesis. For example, in fetal brains deriving from hypothyroxinemic (Tx) rat dams, severe disruption of phosphate metabolism is observed and the ontogenesis of two enzyme activities associated with growth control, protein kinase C and ornithine decarboxylase, are compromised. Development of brain function is also impaired, as evidenced by the dysgenesis of certain neurotransmitter metabolic activities (choline acetyltransferase and DOPA decarboxylase).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) controlled gene expression profiles have been studied in the tail, hind limb and brain tissues during TH-induced and spontaneous Xenopus laevis metamorphosis. Amplified cRNA probes mixed with a universal standard were hybridized to a set of 21,807-sense strand 60-mer oligonucleotides on each slide representing the entries in X. laevis UniGene Build 48. Most of the up-regulated genes in hind limb and brain are the same. This reflects in part the fact that the initial response to TH induction in both tissues is cell proliferation. A large number of up-regulated genes in the limb and brain programs encode common components of the cell cycle, DNA and RNA metabolism, transcription and translation. Notch is one of the few genes that is differentially expressed exclusively in the brain in the first 48 h of TH induction studied in these experiments. The TH-induced gene expression changes in the tail are different from the limb and brain programs. Distinct muscle and fibroblast programs were identified in the tail. Dying muscle fibers in tail (marked by active caspase-3) up-regulate a group of genes that include proteolytic enzymes. At the climax of metamorphosis, tail muscle down-regulates more than half of the genes that encode the glycolytic enzymes in the cytoplasm and the tricarboxylic acid pathway and all five complexes of the electron transport system in mitochondria. These changes in gene expression precede the activation of caspase-3. Some of these same energy metabolism-related genes are up-regulated in the limb and brain programs by TH. A prominent feature of the tail fibroblasts is the down-regulation of several collagen and other extra cellular matrix genes and the up-regulation of hydrolytic enzymes that are responsible for dissolving the notochord and resorbing the tail.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone (T3) is essential for normal development and organ function throughout vertebrates. Its effects are mainly mediated through transcriptional regulation by T3 receptor (TR). The identification and characterization of the immediate early, direct target genes are thus of critical importance in understanding the molecular pathways induced by T3. Unfortunately, this has been hampered by the difficulty to study gene regulation by T3 in uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos. Here we used Xenopus metamorphosis as a model for vertebrate postembryonic development to identify direct T3 response genes in vivo. We took advantage of the ability to easily induce metamorphosis with physiological levels of T3 and to carry out microarray analysis in Xenopus laevis and genome-wide sequence analysis in Xenopus tropicalis. This allowed us to identify 188 up-regulated and 249 down-regulated genes by T3 in the absence of new protein synthesis in whole animals. We further provide evidence to show that these genes contain functional TREs that are bound by TR in tadpoles and that their promoters are regulated by TR in vivo. More importantly, gene ontology analysis showed that the direct up-regulated genes are enriched in categories important for transcriptional regulation and protein degradation-dependent signaling processes but not DNA replication. Our findings thus revealed the existence of interesting pathways induced by T3 at the earliest step of metamorphosis.},

abstract = {Birth in most animal species is triggered by the fetus through activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Preterm birth, may be associated with precocious activation of fetal HPA function, reflecting the fetal response to an adverse intrauterine environment. There is a progressive and concurrent increase of ACTH1-39 and cortisol (F) in the circulation of fetal sheep during the last 15-20 days of pregnancy (term, day 145-150) associated with increased expression of hypothalamic CRH pituitary POMC and adrenal ACTH receptor and steroidogenic enzymes, particularly P450 C17. Similar changes occur with fetal hypoxemia. Negative feedback is ameliorated by decreased pituitary and hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor, increased CBG, and altered fetal pituitary 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. Repeated fetal hypoxemia, diminishes the fetal-pituitary ACTH response, but increases fetal adrenal responsiveness. Fetuses exposed to maternal glucocorticoid in late gestation are growth restricted with altered postnatal HPA responsiveness and glycemic responses that reproduce the insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes. We conclude that the level of fetal HPA activity is crucial not only for determining gestation length, but also predicts pathophysiologic adjustment in later life.},

On the basis of the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action on the heart and cardiovascular system, it is possible to explain the changes in cardiac output, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, vascular resistance, and rhythm disturbances that result from thyroid dysfunction. The importance of the recognition of the effects of thyroid disease on the heart also derives from the observation that restoration of normal thyroid function most often reverses the abnormal cardiovascular hemodynamics. In the present review, we discuss the appropriate thyroid function tests to establish a suspected diagnosis as well as the treatment modalities necessary to restore patients to a euthyroid state. We also review the alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism that accompany chronic congestive heart failure and the approach to the management of patients with amiodarone-induced alterations in thyroid function tests.},

A pertussis toxin-sensitive and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-sensitive cell surface mechanism responsive to T4 and agarose-T4, suggesting a G protein-coupled receptor, was implicated. Cells depleted of MAPK or treated with MAPK pathway inhibitors showed reduced activation of MAPK and of the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT1alpha by T4; they also showed reduced T4 potentiation of the antiviral action of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). T4 treatment caused tyrosine-phosphorylated MAPK-STAT1alpha nuclear complex formation and enhanced Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1alpha, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma. STAT1alpha-deficient cells transfected with STAT1alpha containing an alanine-for-serine substitution at residue 727 (STAT1alphaA727) showed minimal T4-stimulated STAT1alpha activation. IFN-gamma induced the antiviral state in cells containing wild-type STAT1alpha (STAT1alphawt) or STAT1alphaA727; T4 potentiated IFN-gamma action in STAT1alphawt cells but not in STAT1alphaA727 cells. T4-directed STAT1alpha Ser-727 phosphorylation is MAPK mediated and results in potentiated STAT1alpha activation and enhanced IFN-gamma activity.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids, which are widely used as antiinflammatory agents, downregulate the expression of the interleukin 6 gene and of additional cytokine genes involved in inflammatory responses. Conversely, the transcription factor NF-kappa B, a member of the Rel family of transcription factors, has been implicated in the induction of multiple genes involved in the early processes of immune and inflammatory responses. This prompted us to investigate whether one of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exert their antiinflammatory activities is through inhibition of gene activation mediated by NF-kappa B. We report that, in intact cells, activation of the interleukin 6 promoter by a combination of the factor NF-IL6 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B is inhibited by dexamethasone (ligand)-activated glucocorticoid receptor. Conversely, activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter by a combination of dexamethasone and glucocorticoid receptor is inhibited by overexpression of p65. Furthermore, we provide evidence for physical association between glucocorticoid receptor and p65 in protein crosslinking and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, using either in vitro translated proteins or those present in cell extracts. These studies suggest that direct interactions between NF-kappa B and glucocorticoid receptor may partly account for the antiinflammatory properties of glucocorticoids in vivo.},

Our understanding of the effects of thyroid hormones under physiological circumstances, as well as in pathological conditions, has increased dramatically during the last two centuries and it has become clear that overt thyroid dysfunction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Both hypo-and hyperthyroidism and their treatments have been linked with increased risk from cardiovascular disease and the adverse effects of thyrotoxicosis in terms of osteoporosis risk are well established. Although the evidence suggests that successful treatment of overt thyroid dysfunction significantly improves overall survival, the issue of treating mild or subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism remains controversial. Furthermore, the now well-established effects of thyroid hormones on neurodevelopment have sparked a whole new debate regarding the need to screen pregnant women for thyroid function abnormalities. This review describes the current evidence of the effects of thyroid hormone on the cardiovascular, skeletal and neurological systems, as well as the influence of thyroid diseases and their treatments on the development of malignancy. Furthermore we will describe some recent developments in our understanding of the relationship between thyroid status and health.},

We incorporate these findings into the more traditional anti-inflammatory role attributed to glucocorticoids, and propose how the two seemingly disparate processes seamlessly work together to resolve cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli. These ideas provide a framework by which glucocorticoids ready and reinforce the innate immune system, and repress the adaptive immune system, to help to resolve inflammation and restore homeostasis.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones are important regulators of several physiological processes. Despite having been initially named based on their role in glucose metabolism, glucocorticoids are also fundamental in the regulation of developmental, metabolic, and neurobiological processes, as well as several other biological functions. Due to their involvement in a diverse array of biological pathways, its wide spectrum of action, it is predicted that a wide range of genes may have their expression regulated by the activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In fact, it has been demonstrated that in addition to the regulation of several effectors genes, the expression of the gene encoding for GR itself is regulated by physiological stimuli and fine-tuning mechanisms. Importantly, such generalized effector responses and fine-tuning responses seem to be largely mediated by mechanisms of gene regulation. Therefore, this review aims to describe the mechanisms of gene regulation by glucocorticoid hormones, which are capable of regulating differential gene transcription, within a physiological context. From this discussion, we hope to shed light on how a single molecule that is capable of exerting such divergent effects is also capable of promoting such distinct responses in different target tissues.},

abstract = {Binding of steroid and thyroid hormones to their cognate nuclear receptors (NRs) impacts virtually every aspect of postembryonic development, physiology and behavior, and inappropriate signaling by NRs may contribute to disease. While NRs regulate genes by direct binding to hormone response elements in the genome, their actions may depend on the activity of other transcription factors (TFs) that may or may not bind DNA. The Kr\"{u}ppel-like family of transcription factors (KLF) is an evolutionarily conserved class of DNA-binding proteins that influence many aspects of development and physiology. Several members of this family have been shown to play diverse roles in NR signaling. For example, KLFs (1) act as accessory transcription factors for NR actions, (2) regulate expression of NR genes, and (3) as gene products of primary NR response genes function as key players in NR-dependent transcriptional networks. In mouse models, deletion of different KLFs leads to aberrant transcriptional and physiological responses to hormones, underscoring the importance of these proteins in the regulation of hormonal signaling. Understanding the functional relationships between NRs and KLFs will yield important insights into mechanisms of NR signaling. In this review we present a conceptual framework for understanding how KLFs participate in NR signaling, and we provide examples of how these proteins function to effect hormone action.},

Thyroid hormone (T3) markedly repressed activity of the TSHbeta promoter that had been stably integrated into GH(3 )pituitary cells, through the conserved negative regulatory element (NRE) in the promoter. By DNA affinity binding assay, we show that the NRE constitutively binds to the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) present in GH(3 )cells. Significantly, upon addition of T3, the NRE further recruited the thyroid hormone receptor (TRbeta) and another deacetylase, HDAC2. This recruitment coincided with an alteration of in vivo chromatin structure, as revealed by changes in restriction site accessibility. Supporting the direct interaction between TR and HDAC, in vitro assays showed that TR, through its DNA binding domain, strongly bound to HDAC2. Consistent with the role for HDACs in negative regulation, an inhibitor of the enzymes, trichostatin A, attenuated T3-dependent promoter repression. We suggest that ligand-dependent histone deacetylase recruitment is a mechanism of the negative-feedback regulation, a critical function of the pituitary-thyroid axis.},

abstract = {The assembly of transcriptional regulatory DNA sequences into chromatin plays a fundamental role in modulating gene expression. The promoter of the mouse mammary-tumour virus (MMTV) is packaged into a regular array of nucleosomes when it becomes stably integrated into mammalian chromosomes, and has been used to investigate the relationship between chromatin architecture and transcriptional activation by the hormone-bound glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors. In mammalian cells that express both of these receptors, the progesterone receptor activates transcription from transiently transfected MMTV DNA but not from organized chromatin templates. Moreover, the activated progesterone receptor inhibits the chromatin remodelling and consequent transcriptional stimulation that is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Here we investigate the mechanism of this inhibition by characterizing the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with transcriptional co-activator and chromatin remodelling protein complexes. We show that when this receptor is prevented from interacting with the hBRG1/BAF chromatin remodelling complex, it can activate transcription from transiently transfected DNA but not from organized chromatin templates. Our results indicate that it may be possible to separate the transcriptional activation and chromatin remodelling activities of proteins that interact with hormone receptors.},

Serum concentration of 3,3'5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3, rT3) increased appreciably within 8 hours after the first dose of dexamethasone, was maximum at 24-32 hours after beginning dexamethasone, and remained elevated for about 24 hours after discontinuing the steroid. The mean baseline serum rT3 was 58 ng/per 100 ml in treated hypothyroid patients and 119 ng per 100 ml in patients with Graves' disease; the corresponding maximal post-dexamethasone serum rT3 values were 87 and 170 serum concentration of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) decreased. The decrease in serum T3 was significant at about 24 hours after beginning dexamethasone and was maximal at about 30 hours in both groups of cases under study. The decrease in serum T3 persisted in treated hypothyroid cases for about 24-48 hours and in Graves' disease cases as long as studied, at least 5 days after discontinuing hexamethasone. The changes in serum rT3 and T3 could not be attributed to the effect of dexamethasone on serum protein binding of the iodothyronines because the dialyzable fractions of rT3 and T3 following steroid administration were not different from those before it. Serum T4 did not change appreciably in treated hypothyroid cases, but decreased in Graves' disease cases from a mean baseline value of 23.5 mug per 100 ml to 18.4 mug per 100 ml 3 days after beginning dexamethasone. In addition, 3 hyperthyroid cases were studied before, during, and after administration of dexamethasone, 2 mg every 6 h for 5 days. Serum rT3 increased again as noted above and the increase persisted until about 24 hours after the last dose of the steroid. Serum T3 decreased considerably and remained decreased as long as studied, at least 4 days after discontinuing the steroid. Serum T4 decreased appreciably in 2 of the 3 cases studied. The data suggest that 1) conversion of T4 to T3 and to rT3 may occur via two distinct pathways in the metabolism of T4; 2) the changes in serum rT3 and T3 observed in our study may be due in part at least to a steroid-induced 'shift' in the metabolism of T4 whereby conversion of T4 to T3 is diminished and that to rT3 is enhanced; 3) in addition to the effect on peripheral metabolism of T4, steroids appear to reduce the circulating thyroid hormones in Graves' disease by another mechanism, probably by reduction in thyroid secretion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il},

A precise physiological control of inflammation allows a timely reaction to invading pathogens or to other insults without causing overreaction liable to damage the host. The cellular signaling pathways identified as important regulators of inflammation are the signal transduction cascades mediated by the nuclear factor-kappaB and the activator protein-1, which can both be modulated by glucocorticoids. Their use in the clinic includes treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allograft rejection, and allergic skin diseases. Although glucocorticoids have been widely used since the late 1940s, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their antiinflammatory activity are still under investigation.

abstract = {Activated glucocorticoid receptor protein, purified to 40-60\% homogeneity from rat liver extracts, binds selectively in vitro to a cloned fragment of murine mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA. The DNA fragment tested contains about half of the sequences present in intact MTV DNA, and its rate of transcription, like that of the intact viral element, is strongly stimulated by glucocorticoids when it is introduced into the genome of a receptor-containing cell. In contrast, the receptor fails to bind selectively to DNA restriction fragments from E. coli plasmids pBR322 and RSF2124 or from bacteriophages lambda and T4. Preliminary experiments to localize regions within MTV DNA responsible for selective binding have revealed thus far one subfragment that fails to bind the receptor and one selectively bound subfragment that maps far downstream from the 5' terminus of the normal RNA transcript. These studies are consistent with the notion that steroid receptors may modulate rates of transcription by recognizing specific DNA sequences within or near the regulated genes.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) belongs to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, the nuclear hormone receptors. Like other members of the family, the GR possesses a modular structure consisting of three major domains-the N-terminal (NTD), DNA binding (DBD), and ligand binding (LBD). Although the structures of independently expressed GR DBD and LBD are known, the structures of the NTD and of full-length GR are lacking. Both DBD and LBD possess overall globular structures. Not much is known about the structure of the NTD, which contains the powerful AF1/tau1/enh2 transactivation region. Several studies have shown that AF1 region is mostly unstructured and that it can acquire folded functional conformation under certain potentially physiological conditions, namely in the presence of osmolytes, when the GR DBD is bound to glucocorticoid response element (GRE), and when AF1 binds other transcription factor proteins. These conditions are discussed here. The functions of the GR will be fully understood only when its working three-dimensional structure is known. Based on the available data, we propose a model to explain data which are not adequately accounted for in the classical models of GR action. In this review, we summarize and discuss current information on the structure of the GR in the context of its functional aspects, such as protein:DNA and protein:protein interactions. Because of the close similarities in modular organization among the members of the nuclear hormone receptors, the principles discussed here for the GR should be applicable to many other receptors in the family as well.},

The adrenocortical stress response, governed in part by glucocorticoid hormones, influences physiological and behavioural responses of vertebrates to environmental stressors. However, any adaptive role of this response in invasive populations that are expanding into extreme environments is currently unclear. We experimentally manipulated the adrenocortical stress response of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) to investigate its effect on phenotypic performance and fitness at the species' range front in the Tanami Desert, Australia. Here, toads are vulnerable to overheating and dehydration during the annual hot-dry season and display elevated plasma corticosterone levels indicative of severe environmental stress. By comparing unmanipulated control toads with toads whose adrenocortical stress response was manipulated to increase acute physiological stress responsiveness, we found that control toads had significantly reduced daily evaporative water loss and higher survival relative to the experimental animals. The adrenocortical stress response hence appears essential in facilitating complex phenotypic performance and setting fitness trajectories of individuals from invasive species during range expansion.},

@article{Schussler2000,
abstract = {The slow clearance, prolonged half-life, and high serum concentration of thyroxine (T4) are largely due to strong binding by the principal plasma thyroid hormone-binding proteins, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin. These proteins, which shield the hydrophobic thyroid hormones from their aqueous environment, buffer a stable free T4 concentration for cell uptake. Free rather than bound T4 is subject to homeostatic control by the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis. Although it is not a protease inhibitor, sequence analysis identifies TBG as a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family of proteins. Proteolytic cleavage of TBG appears to be a mechanism for site-specific release of T4 independently of homeostatic control. TBG probably facilitates the transport of maternal T4 and iodide to the fetus, although this remains to be proven. High-affinity cellular binding sites for TTR have been described; however, their function and that of choroid plexus synthesis of TTR and transport of T4 into the cerebrospinal fluid remain unclear. Albumin, with the lowest T4 affinity and fastest T4 release of the major T4-binding proteins may promote quick exchange of T4 with tissue sites. The affinity of albumin for T4 is increased by histidine substitution for arginine 218 in the most common form of dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia. However, proline and alanine substitutions at the same site have a similar effect, suggesting that arginine 218 interferes with T4 binding.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroid disease and osteoporosis are common problems often managed by primary care physicians. Despite many studies, confusion still exists about the effect of thyroid hormone on skeletal health. PURPOSE: To review evidence on the effect of thyroid hormone (from hyperthyroidism, exogenous or endogenous suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and thyroid hormone replacement therapy) on skeletal integrity. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of papers published between 1966 and 1997. DATA SELECTION: Cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and meta-analyses that had appropriate control groups (patients matched for age, sex, and menopausal status), made comparisons with established databases, or defined thyroid state by TSH level or thyroid hormone dose were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data synthesis was not straightforward because of changes in doses and types of thyroid hormone preparations; changes in definitions of thyroid hormone replacement therapy and suppressive therapies; problems with study design; differences in skeletal sites assessed (hip, spine, forearm, or heel) and techniques used to measure bone mineral density; and inclusion of heterogenous and changing thyroid disease states. Overall, hyperthyroidism and use of thyroid hormone to suppress TSH because of thyroid cancer, goiters, or nodules seem to have an adverse effect on bone, especially in postmenopausal women; the largest effect is on cortical bone. Thyroid hormone replacement seems to have a minimal clinical effect on bone. CONCLUSION: Women with a history of hyperthyroidism or TSH suppression by thyroid hormone should have skeletal status assessed by bone mineral densitometry, preferably at a site containing cortical bone, such as the hip or forearm.},

abstract = {The presence of the glucocorticoid (GC) receptor is required for GC-evoked apoptosis. However, the explicit mechanism of involvement of this receptor continues to be debated. Employing the murine (S-49) and human (CCRF-CEM) lymphoid cell lines, we demonstrated that this response requires a specialized form of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that resides in the plasma membrane (mGR). Our studies of mGR have been done in our stable mGR-enriched (by sequential cell separation--immunopanning, fluorescent cell sorting, soft agar cloning) S-49 and CCRF-CEM cells. Direct and indirect immunofluorescent studies of live intact cells showed GR-specific periplasma membrane staining. Immunoanalysis by flow cytometry demonstrated abundant mGR in mGR++ cells, but only barely detectable mGR in mGR-- cells. Western blot and autoradiographic analyses of immunoprecipitated membrane extracts from these cells show they contain immunoreactive and competitively labeled high Mr receptor ranging from 94 to 150 kDa. Using mGR++ CCRF-CEM cells and three synchronization procedures (double thymidine, thymidine/colcemid, and colcemid blocks), we have investigated the influence of cell cycle on regulation and function of mGR. Both mGR expression and GC-mediated lymphocytolysis appear highest at late S-G2/M. Analysis of mGR in lymphocytes of several leukemic patients indicated differences in the levels of receptor expression. These findings might provide diagnostic clues about patients' differential response to steroid therapy and potential therapeutic avenues for effective treatment of hormone-responsive leukemic patients.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) primary transcript produces two receptor isoforms, hGRalpha and hGRbeta, which differ at their carboxyl termini. The hGRalpha isoform conveys endocrine information to target tissues by altering patterns of gene expression in a hormone-dependent fashion. In contrast to hGRalpha, very little is known about the hGRbeta splice variant. Using hGRalpha- and hGRbeta-specific riboprobes on human multiple tissue Northern blots, we show that the hGRbeta message has a widespread tissue distribution. We also prove by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that the alternative splicing event underlying the formation of the hGRbeta message occurs in these tissues. Because the hGRbeta protein differs from hGRalpha at the extreme COOH terminus, we investigated several of the biochemical properties of hGRbeta expressed in transfected cells. hGRbeta does not bind the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone nor the glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486 in vivo. Moreover, in contrast to hGRalpha, hGRbeta is located primarily in the nucleus of transfected cells independent of hormone administration. Finally, in the absence of hGRalpha, hGRbeta is transcriptionally inactive on a glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer. However, when both isoforms are expressed in the same cell, hGRbeta inhibits the hormone-induced, hGRalpha-mediated stimulation of gene expression. Thus, hGRbeta potentially functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRalpha activity.},

abstract = {Epidemiological data indicate that an adverse maternal environment during pregnancy predisposes offspring to metabolic syndrome with increased obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms are still unclear although epigenetic modifications are implicated and the hypothalamus is a likely target. We hypothesized that maternal undernutrition (UN) around conception in sheep would lead to epigenetic changes in hypothalamic neurons regulating energy balance in the offspring, up to 5 years after the maternal insult. We found striking evidence of decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoter methylation, decreased histone lysine 27 trimethylation, and increased histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation in hypothalami from male and female adult offspring of UN mothers. These findings are entirely compatible with the increased GR mRNA and protein observed in the hypothalami. The increased GR predicted the decreased hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin expression and increased obesity that we observed in the 5-year-old adult males. The epigenetic and expression changes in GR were specific to the hypothalamus. Hippocampal GR mRNA and protein were decreased in UN offspring, whereas pituitary GR was altered in a sex-specific manner. In peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes there were no changes in GR methylation or protein, indicating that this epigenetic analysis did not predict changes in the brain. Overall, these results suggest that moderate changes in maternal nutrition, around the time of conception, signal life-long and tissue-specific epigenetic alterations in a key gene regulating energy balance in the hypothalamus.},

abstract = {To shed more light on the molecular requirements for recognition of thyroid response elements (TREs) by thyroid receptors (TRs), we compared the specific aspects of DNA TRE recognition by different TR constructs. Using fluorescence anisotropy, we performed a detailed and hierarchical study of TR-TRE binding. This was done by comparing the binding affinities of three different TR constructs for four different TRE DNA elements, including palindromic sequences and direct repeats (F2, PAL, DR-1, and DR-4) as well as their interactions with nonspecific DNA sequences. The effect of MgCl(2) on suppressing of nonselective DNA binding to TR was also investigated. Furthermore, we determined the dissociation constants of the hTRbeta DBD (DNA binding domain) and hTRbeta DBD-LBD (DNA binding and ligand binding domains) for specific TREs. We found that a minimum DNA recognition peptide derived from DBD (H1TR) is sufficient for recognition and interaction with TREs, whereas scrambled DNA sequences were unrecognized. Additionally, we determined that the TR DBD binds to F2, PAL, and DR-4 with high affinity and similar K(d) values. The TR DBD-LBD recognizes all the tested TREs but binds preferentially to F2, with even higher affinity. Finally, our results demonstrate the important role played by LBDs in modulating TR-DNA binding.},

@article{Chatonnet2013,
abstract = {TR$\alpha$1 and TR$\beta$1, the two main thyroid hormone receptors in mammals, are transcription factors that share similar properties. However, their respective functions are very different. This functional divergence might be explained in two ways: it can reflect different expression patterns or result from different intrinsic properties of the receptors. We tested this second hypothesis by comparing the repertoires of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-responsive genes of two neural cell lines, expressing either TR$\alpha$1 or TR$\beta$1. Using transcriptome analysis, we found that a substantial fraction of the T3 target genes display a marked preference for one of the two receptors. So when placed alone in identical situations, the two receptors have different repertoires of target genes. Chromatin occupancy analysis, performed at a genome-wide scale, revealed that TR$\alpha$1 and TR$\beta$1 cistromes were also different. However, receptor-selective regulation of T3 target genes did not result from receptor-selective chromatin occupancy of their promoter regions. We conclude that modification of TR$\alpha$1 and TR$\beta$1 intrinsic properties contributes in a large part to the divergent evolution of the receptors' function, at least during neurodevelopment.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: During the generation of a successful adaptive immune response, multiple molecular signals are required. A primary signal is the binding of cognate antigen to an antigen receptor expressed by T and B lymphocytes. Multiple secondary signals involve the engagement of costimulatory molecules expressed by T and B lymphocytes with their respective ligands. Because of its essential role in immunity, one of the best characterized of the costimulatory molecules is the receptor CD40. This receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, is expressed by B cells, professional antigen-presenting cells, as well as non-immune cells and tumors. CD40 binds its ligand CD40L, which is transiently expressed on T cells and other non-immune cells under inflammatory conditions. A wide spectrum of molecular and cellular processes is regulated by CD40 engagement including the initiation and progression of cellular and humoral adaptive immunity. In this review, we describe the downstream signaling pathways initiated by CD40 and overview how CD40 engagement or antagonism modulates humoral and cellular immunity. Lastly, we discuss the role of CD40 as a target in harnessing anti-tumor immunity. This review underscores the essential role CD40 plays in adaptive immunity.},

@article{Bolt2001,
abstract = {During the final prenatal period of fetal lung development in humans, important maturational processes occur, including the production of surfactant necessary to decrease surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. During early gestation, the glucocorticoid receptor is expressed in the fetal lung, and glucocorticoids stimulate the production of surfactant-associated proteins and increase phospholipid synthesis by enhancing the activity of phosphatidylcholine. Other glucocorticoid-induced effects may include stimulation of cell maturation and differentiation, inhibition of DNA synthesis, changes in interstitial tissue components, stimulation of antioxidant enzymes, and regulation of pulmonary fluid metabolism. Recently, it was suggested that glucocorticoids are also important in postnatal pulmonary development, and may be related to the development of neonatal lung disease in preterm infants. Surfactant deficiency that can be prevented by antenatal corticosteroid treatment causes infant respiratory distress syndrome and requires mechanical ventilation. Ventilation by itself or in combination with high levels of oxygen, fluid overload, pulmonary infections, sepsis, and air leak syndrome causes an acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction that may result in chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of chronic lung disease of prematurity and regulate the inflammatory response by the interaction with transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappaB and activated protein 1. Indeed, inflammatory cells and the levels of chemokines and cytokines in bronchoalveolar fluid decrease after dexamethasone treatment. However, treatment of fetuses and preterm infants with repeated and/or high doses of corticosteroids may have considerable long-term side effects on somatic, brain, and lung growth. The difficult balance between short-term gain and the possible long-term side effects of glucocorticoids in preterms remains a difficult issue.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine (T3) regulates gene expression in a positive and negative manner. Here, we analyzed the regulation of a positively (mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and negatively T3-regulated target gene (TSHalpha). Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activates mGPDH but not TSH promoter fragments in a mammalian one-hybrid assay. Furthermore, we investigated functional consequences of targeting TR to DNA independent of its own DNA-binding domain (DBD). Using a chimeric fusion protein of the DBD of yeast transcription factor Gal4 with TR, we demonstrated a positive regulation of gene transcription in response to T3. T3-mediated activation of this chimeric protein is further increased after an introduction of point mutations within the DBD of TR. Moreover, we investigated the capacity of TR to negatively regulate gene transcription on a DNA-tethered cofactor platform. A direct binding of TR to DNA via its own DBD is dispensable in this assay. We investigated functional consequences of point mutations affecting different domains of TR. Our data indicate that the DBD of TR plays a key role in direct DNA binding on positively but not on negatively T3-regulated target genes. Nevertheless, the DBD is involved in mediating negative gene regulation independent of its capacity to bind DNA.},

abstract = {Several liganded nuclear receptors have alternative ligands acting in a tissue-specific fashion and playing important biological roles. We present evidence that 3,5-diiodothyronine (T(2)), a naturally occurring iodothyronine that results from T(3) outer-ring deiodination, is an alternative ligand for thyroid hormone receptor $\beta$1 (TR$\beta$1). In tilapia, 2 TR$\beta$ isoforms differing by 9 amino acids in the ligand-binding domain were cloned. Binding and transactivation studies showed that T(2) activates the human and the long tilapia TR$\beta$1 isoform, but not the short one. A chimeric human TR$\beta$1 (hTR$\beta$1) that contained the 9-amino-acid insert showed no response to T(2), suggesting that the conformation of the hTR$\beta$1 naturally allows T(2) binding and that other regions of the receptor are implicated in TR activation by T(2). Indeed, further analysis showed that the N terminus is essential for T(2)-mediated transactivation but not for that by T(3) in the long and hTR$\beta$1, suggesting a functional interaction between the N-terminal domain and the insertion in the ligand-binding domain. To establish the functional relevance of T(2)-mediated TR$\beta$1 binding and activation, mRNA expression and its regulation by T(2) and T(3) was evaluated for both isoforms. Our data show that long TR$\beta$1expression is 10(6)-fold higher than that of the short isoform, and T(3) and T(2) differentially regulate the expression of these 2 TR$\beta$1 isoforms in vivo. Taken together, our results prompted a reevaluation of the role and mechanism of action of thyroid hormone metabolites previously believed to be inactive. More generally, we propose that classical liganded receptors are only partially locked to very specific ligands and that alternative ligands may play a role in the tissue-specific action of receptors.},

abstract = {T3 binds to intranuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) on target DNA elements and exerts profound influences on gene expression by mechanisms not yet characterized. We used gel shift assays and cross-linking experiments to demonstrate that T3 greatly induced the monomeric binding of the hTR beta produced in Escherichia coli to DNA. T3 also increased the gel mobility of these monomer-DNA complexes suggesting they undergo a ligand-induced conformational change. This effect did not depend on the orientation and spacing of the half-site motifs within the DNA structure. In contrast, T3 had diverse effects on the dimeric interaction. T3 increased the dimeric interaction to the palindrome GGTCA.TGACC (an effect lost by spacing the half-sites with 3 base pairs) and decreased the dimeric interaction to the inverted palindrome containing the TGACC.GGTCA motif. Scatchard analyses indicated that the T3 enhancement on binding was due to an increase in the number of TR with high affinity DNA-binding activity and not by increasing the affinity of TR that could bind to DNA. The effects of various T3 analogs were directly related to their affinities for the TR. These ligand effects on in vitro TR-DNA binding may reflect mechanisms by which T3 regulates transcription in vivo.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of gene duplications in establishing vertebrate innovations is one of the main challenges of Evo-Devo (evolution of development) studies. Data on evolutionary changes in gene expression (i.e., evolution of transcription factor-cis-regulatory elements relationships) tell only part of the story; protein function, best studied by biochemical and functional assays, can also change. In this study, we have investigated how gene duplication has affected both the expression and the ligand-binding specificity of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which play a major role in chordate embryonic development. Mammals have three paralogous RAR genes--RAR alpha, beta, and gamma--which resulted from genome duplications at the origin of vertebrates. By using pharmacological ligands selective for specific paralogues, we have studied the ligand-binding capacities of RARs from diverse chordates species. We have found that RAR beta-like binding selectivity is a synapomorphy of all chordate RARs, including a reconstructed synthetic RAR representing the receptor present in the ancestor of chordates. Moreover, comparison of expression patterns of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the vertebrates suggests that, of all the RARs, RAR beta expression has remained most similar to that of the ancestral RAR. On the basis of these results together, we suggest that while RAR beta kept the ancestral RAR role, RAR alpha and RAR gamma diverged both in ligand-binding capacity and in expression patterns. We thus suggest that neofunctionalization occurred at both the expression and the functional levels to shape RAR roles during development in vertebrates.},

Some working theories suggest a direct binding of TR to regulatory elements of target genes. Others favour models that are independent of a direct DNA binding event.

Our laboratory reported increased specific metabolic actions of T3 in rat liver by Dexamethasone (Dex) through a mechanism involving an up-regulation of the maximal binding capacity of TR. In this study we further explored the participation of TR in the molecular mechanism of the Dex-induced increase on liver T3-specific metabolic action. Dex administration to adrenalectomized rats induced an increase of liver TRbeta1 protein and mRNA. Nuclear run-on assay revealed that Dex up-regulated the TR gene transcriptional rate. Transfection assay in COS-7 cells indicated that Dex increased the transcriptional activity of the TRbeta1 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Dex induced the binding of additional proteins related to or neighboring the DNA sequence of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding (GRE) half-site in the TRbeta1 promoter. Evidences for an interaction of GR on the TRbeta1 promoter have been obtained. Moreover, the specificity of the GR binding to GRE was determined not only by the GRE DNA sequence, but also by the interaction of the GR with other transacting factors bound to sequences flanking the GRE.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription stimulatory element exists in the 5'-flanking DNA near the rat growth hormone (rGH) gene (Crew, M. D., and Spindler, S. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5018-5022). Progressive deletion-transfection analysis of the 5' end of the gene has led to the identification of two genetic elements responsive to thyroid hormone. The first of these is a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription stimulatory element, or TSE. The TSE induced a thyroid hormone-dependent induction-attenuation transcription cycle similar to that of the natural rGH gene. Deletion of sequences between positions -254 and -241 in the rGH 5'-flanking DNA eliminated TSE activity. The second regulatory element is a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription inhibitory element (TIE). When this element was active, thyroid hormone strongly but transiently inhibited rGH promoter utilization. Deletion of sequences between nucleotides -46 and -21 abolished the effects of the TIE. To determine whether the TSE and TIE are enhancer-like, we ligated various regions of rat growth hormone 5'-flanking DNA containing these elements to a chimeric test gene containing the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Thyroid hormone activated heterologous promoter utilization when a rat growth hormone 5'-flanking DNA fragment containing the TSE (-520 to -115) was linked in cis, regardless of the distance or orientation of the TSE with respect to the promoter. These data suggest that the TSE is a thyroid hormone-dependent enhancer. In contrast, when the TIE was placed immediately 5' to the thymidine kinase promoter, transcription was not effected by 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine, suggesting that the TIE is not enhancer-like.},

@article{Wada2008,
abstract = {In adult vertebrates, glucocorticoids are thought to trigger transitions between life history stages within breeding cycles. This review explores possible roles of glucocorticoids as mediators for vertebrate ontogenetic transitions. Overall, glucocorticoids prepare organisms and trigger transitions into the subsequent life history stage. Across taxa, ability to secrete glucocorticoids appears to depend on functional maturity at birth. Slow strategist or precocial species tend to have larger, fewer, and more mature young that can secrete glucocorticoids earlier than fast strategist or altricial species. Across life history transitions, glucocorticoids have direct and permissive effects on various ontogenetic transitions in vertebrates. Glucocorticoids directly (1) promote maturation of critical organs before birth/hatch in mammals and birds, (2) initiate parturition events in mammals and possibly controls hatching in birds and reptiles (but not in "small"-egg fish), (3) facilitate acquisition of osmoregulatory ability in fish during smoltification, and (4) affect dispersal behavior in mammals, birds, and reptiles and are potential candidates for the timing of fledging in birds, although further studies are needed to determine the causal relationship. Glucocorticoids also have a permissive action on thyroid hormones in amphibian and fish metamorphosis.},

abstract = {Prolactin (PRL) has long been implicated in Xenopus metamorphosis as an anti-metamorphic and/or juvenilizing hormone. Numerous studies showed that PRL could prevent effects of either endogenous or exogenous thyroid hormone (TH; T(3)). It has been shown that expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is induced by TH during Xenopus metamorphosis. Direct in vivo evidence, however, for such anti-TH effects by PRL with respect to MMPs has not been available for the early phase of Xenopus development or metamorphosis. To understand the functional role of PRL, we investigated effects of PRL on Xenopus collagenase-3 (XCL3) and collagenase-4 (XCL4) expression in a cultured Xenopus laevis cell line, XL-177. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that XCL3 and XCL4 expression were not detected in control or T(3)-treated cells, but were differentially induced by PRL in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Moreover, treatment with IL-1alpha as well as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, or H8, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, augmented PRL-induced collagenase expression, suggesting that multiple protein kinase pathways and cytokines may participate in PRL-induced collagenase expression. Interestingly, XCL3 expression could be induced in XL-177 cells by T(3), but only when co-cultured with prometamorphic Xenopus tadpole tails (stage 54/55), suggesting that the tails secrete a required intermediate signaling molecule(s) for T(3)-induced XCL3 expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that XCL3 and XCL4 can be differentially induced by PRL and T(3) and further suggest that PRL is a candidate regulator of TH-independent collagenase expression during the organ/tissue remodeling which occurs in Xenopus development.},

They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function, but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear. Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in mice and cultured cells. This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein, which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes. Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids.},

abstract = {Hormone-activated ERs (ERalpha and ERbeta) bind with high affinity to specific DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (EREs), located within the regulatory regions of target genes. Once considered to function solely as receptor tethers, there is an increasing amount of recent evidence to suggest that the sequence of the ERE can influence receptor activity. In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis of the role of different EREs in ER pharmacology. Specifically, by measuring ER activity on the vitellogenin A2, complement 3 gene, pS2, and lactoferrin EREs, we demonstrate that the activities of E2 and xenoestrogen ligands through ERalpha and ERbeta are significantly influenced by the nature of the response element. Using a series of ERalpha and ERbeta interacting peptides that contain the coactivator-binding motif LXXLL, we show that the type of ERE with which the receptor associates regulates the structure of the coactivator pocket on ER. Furthermore, using a novel ELISA developed to measure ER-coactivator interactions revealed that these different conformational states of ERalpha and ERbeta are functionally relevant, as they dictate receptor coactivator binding preference. Together, these results indicate that the DNA response element is a key regulator of receptor structure and biological activity and suggest the ERE sequence influences the recruitment of coactivators to the ER at target gene promoters. We propose that DNA-induced alteration of protein structure and coregulator recruitment may serve as a universal regulatory component for differential gene expression by other nuclear hormone receptors and unrelated transcription factors.},

Such receptors are found in physiological mineralocorticoid target tissues (kidney, parotid, and colon) and in nontarget tissues such as hippocampus and heart. In mineralocorticoid target tissues the receptors are selective for aldosterone in vivo because of the presence of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase, which converts cortisol and corticosterone, but not aldosterone, to their 11-keto analogs.

To identify the precise contact sites on a synthetic DR4 (TRE half-sites arranged as a direct repeat with a four-nucleotide spacer) and a chick lysoenzyme TRE, F2 (half-sites arranged as an inverted palindrome with a six-nucleotide spacer), for various TR complexes, mobility shift assays, and dimethylsulfate and KMnO4 DNA modification interference assays were employed. First, TR alpha monomer bound to the downstream half-site of these TREs, whereas TR alpha homodimer bound to both half-sites.

Second, the specific flanking and spacing sequences of DR4 influenced the contact sites and the binding of TR alpha monomer and homodimer, but not TR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimer. Finally, cotransfection studies, using reporter plasmids containing DR4 or F2 in both orientations with respect to the basal promoter, provide evidence that preferential contact with the down-stream half-site by TR/RXR heterodimer may be important for maximal transcriptional activation.},

abstract = {In this study DNA-binding and gene transfer experiments were performed to examine a potential glucocorticoid regulatory element (GRE) in the human growth hormone gene. As assayed by nitrocellulose filter binding, only two regions of the human growth hormone gene, the 5'-flanking sequences and a fragment containing part of the first intron, were retained preferentially by purified glucocorticoid-receptor complexes. The relative binding by the transcribed sequences was three times greater than the relative binding by the 5'-flanking sequences, but less than the relative binding by a fragment containing the human metallothionein-IIA gene GRE. The intron, but not the 5'-flanking sequences, generated a "footprint" when the receptor complex was used to protect the segments against exonuclease III digestion; the protected sequence spanned nucleotides +86 to +115 in the first intron and contained a structure homologous in 14 of 16 nucleotides to a 16-nucleotide consensus GRE. The hexanucleotide 5'-TGTCCT-3', thought to be important for GRE activity, not only was found in this sequence and in the 5'-flanking region, but also was present twice in the 3' end of the gene that did not show specific receptor binding. The latter results suggest that the hexanucleotide alone is not sufficient to generate specific receptor binding tight enough to be assayed in this way. To test the biological activity of the intron binding site, a fragment containing these sequences was fused 5' to the human metallothionein-IIA gene promoter depleted of its GRE and linked to the structural sequences of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene. When this hybrid gene was transfected into Rat 2 TK- cells, its expression was induced threefold by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, as assessed by transfection efficiency and RNA blotting analyses. Expression of the same gene without the human growth hormone gene segment was not affected by the steroid, whereas the wild-type human metallothionein-IIA gene promoter containing its GRE responded to the hormone by a sixfold increase in thymidine kinase mRNA. These results indicate that the human growth hormone gene contains a structure within its first intron that can function as a GRE.},

abstract = {Congenital hyperthyroidism is a very rare disease. But, for each affected child it has to be considered as a serious condition because of the negative impact of hyperthyroidism on fetal and postnatal development. If the manifestation occurs during fetal life tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, growth retardation and, most significant, prematurity are the consequences. Postnatal signs of hyperthyroidism are irritability, tachycardia, hypertension, poor weight gain and thyroid enlargement. Even cardiac failure may occur if hyperthyroidism is severe and treatment not adequate which explains the high early mortality rate of 16\%. The main complication of persistent hyperthyroidism in the neonatal period and during infancy is craniosynostosis. Severe developmental delay or even mental retardation can be the consequence of inadequate high T4-levels during fetal and neonatal life. Congenital hyperthyroidism was first recognized in infants born to mothers with Graves' disease. The description of transplacental passage of the maternal thyroid stimulating antibodies elucidated the molecular mechanism in this major group of patients with "autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism". In contrast to this transient, self-limited character of "autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism", due to the clearance of maternal antibodies from the infant's circulation, some cases of persistent congenital hyperthyroidism without signs of thyroid autoimmunity have been recognized. Activating mutations in the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor were described recently as the underlying molecular pathogenesis in this group of "non-immune congenital hyperthyroidism". Therefore the possibility of a molecular differential diagnosis of both groups of congenital hyperthyroidism now exists and opens the opportunity of optimal treatment for each patient.},

abstract = {Steroids may rapidly alter neuronal function and behavior through poorly characterized, direct actions on neuronal membranes. The membrane-bound receptors mediating these behavioral responses have not been identified. [3H]Corticosterone labels a population of specific, high-affinity recognition sites (dissociation constant = 0.51 nanomolar) in synaptic membranes from an amphibian brain. These binding sites were localized by receptor autoradiography in the neuropil, outside the regions of perikarya. The affinities of corticoids for this [3H]corticosterone binding site were linearly related to their potencies in rapidly suppressing male reproductive behavior. Thus, it appears that brain membranes contain a corticosteroid receptor that could participate in the regulation of behavior.},

abstract = {Adrenal corticosteroids (CORT) have a profound effect on the function of the hippocampus. This is mediated in a coordinated manner by mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) via activation or repression of target genes. The aim of this study was to identify, using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), CORT-responsive hippocampal genes regulated via MR and/or GR. SAGE profiles were compared under different conditions of CORT exposure, resulting in the identification of 203 CORT-responsive genes that are involved in many different cellular processes like, energy expenditure and cellular metabolism; protein synthesis and turnover; signal transduction and neuronal connectivity and neurotransmission. Besides some previously identified CORT-responsive genes, the majority of the genes identified in this study were novel. In situ hybridization revealed that six randomly chosen CORT-responsive genes had distinct expression patterns in neurons of the hippocampus. In addition, using in situ hybridization, we confirmed that these six genes were indeed regulated by CORT, underscoring the validity of the SAGE data. Comparison of MR- and GR-dependent expression profiles revealed that the majority of the CORT-responsive genes were regulated either by activated MR or by activated GR, while only a few genes were responsive to both activated MR and GR. This indicates that the molecular basis for the differential effects of activated MR and GR is activation or repression of distinct, yet partially overlapping sets of genes. The putative CORT-responsive genes identified here will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential and sometimes opposing effects of MR and GR on neuronal excitability, memory formation and behaviour as well as their role in neuronal protection and damage.},

abstract = {The functions of the group of proteins known as nuclear receptors will be understood fully only when their working three-dimensional structures are known. These ligand-activated transcription factors belong to the steroid-thyroid-retinoid receptor superfamily, which include the receptors for steroids, thyroid hormone, vitamins A- and D-derived hormones, and certain fatty acids. The majority of family members are homologous proteins for which no ligand has been identified (the orphan receptors). Molecular cloning and structure/function analyses have revealed that the members of the superfamily have a common functional domain structure. This includes a variable N-terminal domain, often important for transactivation of transcription; a well conserved DNA-binding domain, crucial for recognition of specific DNA sequences and protein:protein interactions; and at the C-terminal end, a ligand-binding domain, important for hormone binding, protein: protein interactions, and additional transactivation activity. Although the structure of some independently expressed single domains of a few of these receptors have been solved, no holoreceptor structure or structure of any two domains together is yet available. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of the DNA-binding domains of the glucocorticoid, estrogen, retinoic acid-beta, and retinoid X receptors, and of the ligand-binding domains of the thyroid, retinoic acid-gamma, retinoid X, estrogen, progesterone, and peroxisome proliferator activated-gamma receptors have been solved. The secondary structure of the glucocorticoid receptor N-terminal domain, in particular the taul transcription activation region, has also been studied. The structural studies available not only provide a beginning stereochemical knowledge of these receptors, but also a basis for understanding some of the topological details of the interaction of the receptor complexes with coactivators, corepressors, and other components of the transcriptional machinery. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current information on structures of the steroid-thyroid-retinoid receptors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids play a critical role in normative regulation of fetal brain development. Exposure to excessive levels may have detrimental consequences and disrupt maturational processes. This may especially be true when synthetic glucocorticoids are administered during the fetal period, as they are to women in preterm labor. This study investigated the consequences for brain development and affective problems of fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids.

METHODS: Brain development and affective problems were evaluated in 54 children (56\% female), aged 6 to 10, who were full term at birth. Children were recruited into two groups: those with and without fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and cortical thickness was determined. Child affective problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist.

RESULTS: Children in the fetal glucocorticoid exposure group showed significant and bilateral cortical thinning. The largest group differences were in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). More than 30\% of the rACC was thinner among children with fetal glucocorticoid exposure. Furthermore, children with more affective problems had a thinner left rACC.

CONCLUSIONS: Fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids has neurologic consequences that persist for at least 6 to 10 years. Children with fetal glucocorticoid exposure had a thinner cortex primarily in the rACC. Our data indicating that the rACC is associated with affective problems in conjunction with evidence that this region is involved in affective disorders raise the possibility that glucocorticoid-associated neurologic changes increase vulnerability to mental health problems.},

abstract = {The thyroid hormone receptor-coding locus, c-erbA alpha, generates several mRNAs originating from a single primary transcript that undergoes alternative splicing. We have identified for the first time two new transcripts, called TRdelta alpha1 and TRdelta alpha2 [mRNA for isoform alpha1 and alpha2 of the T3 receptor (TR), respectively], whose transcription is initiated from an internal promoter located within intron 7 of the c-erbA alpha gene. These two new transcripts exhibit tissue-specific patterns of expression in the mouse. These two patterns are in sharp contrast with the expression patterns of the full-length transcripts generated from the c-erbA alpha locus. TR alpha1 and TRdelta alpha2 mRNAs encode N-terminally truncated isoforms of T3R alpha1 and T3R alpha2, respectively. The protein product of TRdelta alpha1 antagonizes the transcriptional activation elicited by T3 and retinoic acid. This protein inhibits the ligand-induced activating functions of T3R alpha1 and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor-alpha but does not affect the retinoic acid-dependent activating function of retinoic acid receptor-alpha. We predict that these truncated proteins may work as down-regulators of transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors in vivo.},

abstract = {Cholesterol and phospholipid are the two major lipids of the red cell membrane. Cholesterol is insoluble in water but is solubilized by phospholipids both in membranes and in plasma lipoproteins. Morever, cholesterol exchanges between membranes and lipoproteins. An equilibrium partition is established based on the amount of cholesterol relative to phospholipid (C/PL) in these two compartments. Increases in the C/PL of red cell membranes have been studied under three conditions: First, spontaneous increases in vivo have been observed in the spur red cells of patients with severe liver disease; second, similar red cell changes in vivo have been induced by the administration of cholesterol-enriched diets to rodents and dogs; third, increases in membrane cholesterol have been induced in vitro by enriching the C/PL of the lipoprotein environment with cholesterol-phospholipid dispersions (liposomes) having a C/PL of greater than 1.0. In each case, there is a close relationship between the C/PL of the plasma environment and the C/PL of the red cell membrane. In vivo, the C/PL mole ratio of red cell membranes ranges from a normal value of 0.09--1.0 to values which approach but do not reach 2.0. In vitro, this ratio approaches 3.0. Cholesterol enrichment of red cell membranes directly influences membrane lipid fluidity, as assessed by the rotational diffusion of hydrophobic fluorescent probes such as diphenyl hexatriene (DPH). A close correlation exists between increases in red cell membrane C/PL and decreases in membrane fluidity over the range of membrane C/PL from 1.0 to 2.0; however, little further change in fluidity occurs when membrane C/PL is increased to 2.0--3.0. Cholesterol enrichment of red cell membranes is associated with the transformation of cell contour to one which is redundant and folded, and this is associated with a decrease in red cell filterability in vitro. Circulation in vivo in the presence of the spleen further modifies cell shape to a spiny, irregular (spur) form, and the survival of cholesterol-rich red cells is decreased in the presence of the spleen. Although active Na-K transport is not influenced by cholesterol enrichment of human red cells, several carrier-mediated transport pathways are inhibited. We have demonstrated this effect for the cotransport of Na + K and similar results have been obtained by others in studies of organic acid transport and the transport of small neutral molecules such as erythritol and glycerol. Thus, red cell membrane C/PL is sensitive to the C/PL of the plasma environment. Increasing membrane C/PL causes a decrease in membrane fluidity, and these changes are associated with a reduction in membrane permeability, a distortion of cell contour and filterability and a shortening of the survival of red cells in vivo.},

In particular, a great step was taken with the discovery that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC-1alpha) is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the downregulation of PGC-1alpha and the consequent decrease in mitochondrial function in heart failure are, however, still poorly understood. Indeed, the main pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis are thought to be up- rather than down-regulated in pathological hypertrophy and heart failure.

abstract = {To evaluate the role of anti-insulin hormone actions and interactions in the pathogenesis of stress-induced hyperglycemia, the counterregulatory hormones, glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol were infused alone as well as in double and triple combinations into normal conscious dogs in doses that were designed to simulate changes observed in severe stress. Infusion of glucagon, epinephrine, or cortisol alone produced only mild or insignificant elevations in plasma glucose concentration. In contrast, the rise in plasma glucose produced by combined infusion of any two counterregulatory hormones was 50-215\% greater (P < 0.005-0.001) than the sum of the respective individual infusions. Furthermore, when all three hormones were infused simultaneously, the increment in plasma glucose concentration (144+/-2 mg/dl) was two- to fourfold greater than the sum of the responses to the individual hormone infusions or the sum of any combination of double plus single hormone infusion (P < 0.001). Infusion of glucagon or epinephrine alone resulted in a transient rise in glucose production (as measured by [3-(3)H]glucose). While glucagon infusion was accompanied by a rise in glucose clearance, with epinephrine there was a sustained, 20\% fall in glucose clearance. When epinephrine was infused together with glucagon, the rise in glucose production was additive, albeit transient. However, the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on glucose clearance predominated, thereby accounting for the exaggerated glycemic response to combined infusion of glucagon and epinephrine. Although infusion of cortisol alone had no effect on glucose production, the addition of cortisol markedly accentuated hyperglycemia produced by glucagon and(or) epinephrine primarily by sustaining the increases in glucose production produced by these hormones. The combined hormonal infusions had no effect on beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration. It is concluded that (a) physiologic increments in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol interact synergistically in the normal dog so as to rapidly produce marked fasting hyperglycemia; (b) in this interaction, epinephrine enhances glucagon-stimulated glucose output and interferes with glucose uptake while cortisol sustains elevations in glucose production produced by epinephrine and glucagon; and (c) these data indicate that changes in glucose metabolism in circumstances in which several counterregulatory hormones are elevated (e.g., "stress hyperglycemia") are a consequence of synergistic interactions among these hormones.},

abstract = {The nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone require a plasma membrane receptor or nuclear receptors located in cytoplasm. The plasma membrane receptor is located on integrin alphaVbeta3 at the Arg-Gly-Asp recognition site important to the binding by the integrin of extracellular matrix proteins. l-Thyroxine (T(4)) is bound with greater affinity at this site than 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3)). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) transduces the hormone signal into complex cellular/nuclear events including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Acting at the integrin receptor and without cell entry, thyroid hormone can foster ERK1/2-dependent serine phosphorylation of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor-beta1 (TRbeta1) and de-repress the latter. The integrin receptor also mediates actions of the hormone on intracellular protein trafficking and on plasma membrane ion pumps, including the sodium/protein antiporter. Tetraiodothyroacetic (tetrac) is a T(4) analog that inhibits binding of iodothyronines to the integrin receptor and is a probe for the participation of this receptor in cellular actions of the hormone. Tetrac blocks thyroid hormone effects on angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation. Acting on a truncated form of nuclear TRalpha1 (TRDeltaalpha1) located in cytoplasm, T(4) and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T(3)), but not T(3), cause conversion of soluble actin to fibrous (F) actin that is important to cell motility, e.g., in cells such as glia and neurons. Normal development of the central nervous system requires such motility. TRbeta1 in cytoplasm mediates action of T(3) on expression of certain genes via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and the protein kinase B/Akt pathway. PI 3-K and, possibly, cytoplasmic TRbeta1 are involved in stimulation by T(3) of insertion of Na,K-ATPase in the plasma membrane and of increase in activity of this pump. Because ambient thyroid hormone levels are constant in the euthyroid intact organism, these nongenomic hormone actions are likely to be contributors to basal rate-setting of transcription of certain genes and of complex cellular events such as angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation.},

This portion of C/EBPalpha is responsible for direct inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and causes growth arrest in cultured cells. C/EBPalpha inhibits cdk2 activity by blocking the association of cdk2 with cyclins. Importantly, the activities of cdk4 and cdk2 are increased in C/EBPalpha knockout livers, leading to increased proliferation. Our data demonstrate that the liver-specific transcription factor C/EBPalpha brings about growth arrest through direct inhibition of cdk2 and cdk4.},

abstract = {Transcriptional activation from chromatin by nuclear receptors (NRs) requires multiple cofactors including CBP/p300, SWI/SNF and Mediator. How NRs recruit these multiple cofactors is not clear. Here we show that activation by androgen receptor and thyroid hormone receptor is associated with the promoter targeting of SRC family members, p300, SWI/SNF and the Mediator complex. We show that recruitment of SWI/SNF leads to chromatin remodeling with altered DNA topology, and that both SWI/SNF and p300 histone acetylase activity are required for hormone-dependent activation. Importantly, we show that both the SWI/SNF and Mediator complexes can be targeted to chromatin by p300, which itself is recruited through interaction with SRC coactivators. Furthermore, histone acetylation by CBP/p300 facilitates the recruitment of SWI/SNF and Mediator. Thus, our data indicate that multiple cofactors required for activation are not all recruited through their direct interactions with NRs and underscore a role of cofactor-cofactor interaction and histone modification in coordinating the recruitment of multiple cofactors.},
